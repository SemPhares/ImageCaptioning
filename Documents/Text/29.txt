                Eocene time (e.g., Gutnic et al., 1979; Özgül, 1984). This was followed by Mio-Pliocene thrusting of Miocene basins
                that unconformably covered the deformed western Central Taurides (Figure 2a; Ciner et al., 2008; Poisson et al.,
                2003). Koç, Kaymakci, et al. (2016) and Koç, van Hinsbergen, et al. (2016) suggested that renewed subduction of
                the Antalya slab may have been a driving factor in that Miocene deformation and that the slab may still be
                contiguous with the continental Beydağları foreland of the western Central Taurides (Figure 2a); however,
                how the Eocene and older history of the Taurides links to Miocene deformation is unknown.
                In this paper, we aim to interpret the composition and subduction history of the Antalya slab and estimate
                the timing of its decoupling from the Cyprus slab by investigating the timing and magnitude of shortening
                during accretion of the western Central Taurides. To this end, we describe the structural style of the fold-
                thrust belt and interpret the subsurface structure of the belt. We present the ﬁrst balanced cross section of
                the western Central Taurides composite fold-thrust belt from the Beydağları platform to the Central
                Taurides intramontane basins, over a distance of ~150 km (Figures 2a and 3). We investigate the minimum
                amount of subduction that must have occurred during the formation of the fold-thrust belt. We then evaluate
                the kinematic evolution of the Taurides in the context of Africa-Eurasia convergence and subduction.

                2. Geological Setting
                The Taurides are a fold-thrust belt that forms a mountain range along the southern margin of the Central
                Anatolian Plateau up to ~2.8 km high, with kilometer-scale relief. The fold-thrust belt predominantly consists
                of nonmetamorphic platform carbonate rocks, and minor deep-marine rocks. These are covered by an
                ophiolite-bearing nappe that forms the highest structural unit. The Taurides form the southernmost unit in a
                Late Cretaceous-Eocene accretionary orogen that makes up the Central Anatolian crust to the south of the
                Izmir-Ankara suture zone in northern Turkey (e.g., Sengör & Yilmaz, 1981). Units within that orogen may have
                originated as the eastern part of a microcontinental domain that occupied much of the Mediterranean region,
                known as the Adria-Turkey plate (Stampﬂi et al., 1991) or Greater Adria (Gaina et al., 2013). This microcontinen-
                tal domain was separated from Eurasia in the north and Africa in the south by ocean basins.
                All tectonic units in the Anatolian orogen are overlain by a Late Cretaceous (~95–90 Ma) ophiolite and
                ophiolitic melange (e.g., Dilek et al., 1999; Çelik et al., 2011; Parlak, 2016; van Hinsbergen et al., 2016, and
                references therein). The ophiolites originated in an intraoceanic subduction zone that formed in the
                Neotethys Ocean to the north of the Anatolian part of Greater Adria around ~100 Ma (Gürer et al., 2016;

                which have been part of Eurasia since Triassic times (Dokuz et al., 2017; Okay et al., 2006). A second
                subduction zone existed along the southern Pontides margin from Jurassic until latest Cretaceous to
                Paleogene time as shown by arc volcanism, accreted and metamorphosed rocks, and forearc basin evolution
                (e.g., Kaymakci et al., 2009; Okay et al., 2013, 2014; Topuz et al., 2014).
                Closure of the Neotethys Ocean basin between the Pontides and the Anatolian part of Greater Adria was
                accommodated on two trenches, until the Pontides-Taurides collision in latest Cretaceous to Paleogene
                time. After that, subduction remained active on the southern (formerly the intraoceanic) trench (Gürer
                et al., 2016). The location of the former Neotethys Ocean is demarcated by the Izmir-Ankara suture zone
                (Sengör & Yilmaz, 1981; Figure 2a).
                Three belts of metamorphic rocks are present north of the Taurides: the Tavşanlı zone in the northwest, the
                Kırşehir Block in the northeast, and the Afyon zone in the south. These are the northern parts of the Greater
                Adria microcontinental domain that were underthrusted and metamorphosed below the Anatolian

                ophiolites in Late Cretaceous time, with overall southward younging metamorphism and thrusting (e.g., Okay
                et al., 2001; Pourteau et al., 2010; van Hinsbergen, Kaymakci, et al., 2010; van Hinsbergen et al., 2016; Plunder
                et al., 2013, 2016; see Figure 2b). The metamorphic units in Anatolia were likely exhumed along extensional
                detachment faults in Late Cretaceous to early Eocene times (Gautier et al., 2002; Gautier et al., 2008, 2018;
                Lefebvre et al., 2011, 2015).
                The Taurides are composed of a nonmetamorphic thrusted carbonate platform and slope-derived rocks (e.g.,
                Gutnic et al., 1979; Özgül, 1984). These consist of the allochthonous Bolkardağı and Aladağ nappes, the para
                autochthonous Geyikdağı unit, and autochthonous Beydağları platform (Figure 2b). These units underlie an
                allochthonous nappe composed of ophiolites, ophiolitic mélange, and allochthonous Mesozoic carbonate
                blocks (e.g., Okay, 1984) collectively known as the Bozkır nappes (e.g., Andrew & Robertson, 2002; Özgül,
                1976). The mélange matrix contains Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) planktonic foraminifera showing that
                it formed after that time (Özgül, 1997). Regionally, the Bozkır nappes were thrust over the coherent but
                internally deformed Bolkardağı and Aladağ nappes. The Bolkardağı nappe is the northernmost of these
                nappes and contains nonmetamorphosed sedimentary rocks Taurides in the southwestern Taurides.
                Toward the northeast, it was affected by an increasing grade of metamorphism where it becomes part of
                the Afyon zone (Candan et al., 2005; Okay, 1984). The Bolkardağı nappe accreted below the Bozkır nappes
                in Campanian-Maastrichtian times based on the age of the uppermost synorogenic sedimentary rocks in
                the nappe, the age of the overlying melange matrix (Mackintosh & Robertson, 2012), and 70–65 Ma
                40
                   Ar/39Ar cooling ages in the metamorphosed parts of the nappe (Özdamar et al., 2013; Pourteau et al.,
                2013). In the Derebucak area, the Bolkardağı nappe is not exposed; however, but it becomes a major unit
                of the internal nappe stack southward along the Central Taurides (Figure 3), where it consists of polymeta-
                morphic Precambrian basement and low-grade metamorphic Upper Paleozoic to Lower Paleocene sedimen-
                tary rocks (Demirtasli et al., 1984).
                The Aladağ nappe forms the southern part of the allochthonous nappes (Özgül, 1976). In the southeast of the
                western Central Taurides near the town of Hadim, the Aladağ nappe was backthrust northeastward over
                the Bolkardağı nappe. Locally, the Aladağ nappe is covered by ophiolitic melange of the Bozkır nappes.

                The Aladağ nappe contains an Upper Devonian to Maastrichtian sequence of shelf carbonate and clastic
                rocks (Özgül, 1976; Figure 4).
                The allochthonous Bozkır, Bolkardağı, and Aladağ nappes were thrust over the Geyikdağı unit, which makes up
                the high elevation axis of the western Central Taurides (Figure 2b). In the northern part of the western Central
                Taurides, the Bozkır nappe is in direct contact with the Geyikdağı unit, and the Aladağ and Bolkardağı nappes
                are absent. In places, the Aladağ nappe is underlain by thin slivers of deep-marine sedimentary rocks, which are
                as young as Campanian-Maastrichtian age (Özgül, 1976; Mackintosh & Robertson, 2012). The structural and
                paleogeographic context of those rocks is enigmatic, but they may be derived from a deep basin, which has
                been referred to as the Dipsiz Göl basin that existed between the Aladağ nappe and the Geyikdağı unit platform.
                The stratigraphy of the Geyikdağı unit varies regionally in terms of thickness and stratigraphic continuity but
                in its most complete form consists of Precambrian to Ordovician sedimentary rocks and an overlying
                sequence of Mesozoic to Paleogene carbonate rocks (e.g., Gutnic et al., 1979; Özgül, 1976; Figure 4). Within
                the study area, the Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous stratigraphy varies spatially (see Gutnic et al., 1979 for
                detailed descriptions). The Upper Cretaceous stratigraphy generally consists of shallow water to peritidal
                platform carbonates and rudist-bearing neritic limestones.
                The top of the Geyikdağı unit stratigraphy is composed of marl and coarse sandstone with ophiolitic pebbles.
                Blocks derived from the allochthonous nappes become more common toward the hinterland (northeast).
                Gutnic et al. (1979) interpreted this as a foreland basin deposit deposited onto nummulitic limestone at
                the top of the carbonate sequence. The youngest reported foreland basin deposits are of late Lutetian age
                (~40 Ma), constraining the maximum age of thrusting in the Geyikdağı unit (Gutnic et al., 1979).
                The Beydağları platform of southwest Turkey is the lowest structural unit in the Taurides. It forms the foreland
                of the western Central Taurides fold-thrust belt and is used as the regional pin line for our reconstruction. The
                Beydağları platform contains an exposed sequence of Mesozoic to Oligocene platform carbonate rocks (Özer
                et al., 2001). A 1-km-thick sequence of clastic sedimentary rocks was deposited onto the Beydağları platform in
                Miocene times, in response to the emplacement of the east-verging Lycian Nappes (Hayward, 1982). The
                emplacement of the Lycian Nappes may have been gravitationally driven and occurred during regional exten-
                sion and exhumation in the Menderes region of western Turkey (van Hinsbergen, 2010), which was associated
                with Aegean extension to the west of the Taurides (e.g., Gessner et al., 2013; van Hinsbergen & Schmid, 2012).
                The Beydağları platform underwent a middle Miocene to Pliocene ~20° anticlockwise rotation in the eastern
                limb of the Aegean orocline (Kissel & Poisson, 1987; Morris & Robertson, 1993; van Hinsbergen, Dekkers,
                Bozkurt, & Koopman, 2010; van Hinsbergen, Dekkers, & Koç, 2010; van Hinsbergen & Schmid, 2012). Miocene
                sedimentary rocks of the Aksu basin did not rotate with the Beydağları platform (Koç, van Hinsbergen,
                et al., 2016), indicating that the Aksu basin and Beydağları platform were decoupled by major structures.
                While the fold-thrust belt from the Bozkır nappes to the Beydağları platform was an overall southwest propa-
                gating thrust system, southwest Turkey contains another fold-thrust belt that already existed in Late
                Cretaceous to Paleocene time: the Alanya-Antalya Nappes. Those were thrust over the southern margin of
                the Geyikdağı-Beydağları platforms from south to north (Özgül, 1984) and therefore do not follow the general
                southwest-younging trend in ages of metamorphism and thrusting that is found in the rest of central and
                western Turkey. Paleocene marine sedimentary rocks seal frontal thrust contacts within the Antalya-Alanya
                Nappes near Alanya (Gutnic et al., 1979), indicating that accretion of the nappes was complete well before
                SW verging thrusting affected the Geyikdağı unit in Eocene time.
                The Antalya Nappes are the lowermost structural unit and contain sedimentary and volcanic rocks inter-
                preted as the folded and thrusted southern passive margin of the Geyikdağı-Beydağları platforms (Dumont
                et al., 1972; Robertson & Woodcock, 1984). We use the nomenclature and tectonostratigraphic subdivisions
                of Yilmaz and Maxwell (1984) as used in the 1:100,000 map series of the General Directorate of Mineral
                Research and Exploration Turkey (MTA); outlined in Figure 2b. The Alanya Nappes are structurally above
                the Antalya Nappes and consists of high-pressure low-temperature metamorphic rocks, which experienced
                peak metamorphism at ~85–80 Ma (Çetinkaplan et al., 2016; Okay & Özgül, 1984). The highest structural unit
                is a dismembered ~95–90 Ma ophiolite (Çelik et al., 2006), which is in direct contact with the Antalya Nappes
                on the eastern side of the Gulf of Antalya (Figures 2a and 2c). The ophiolites were emplaced northward onto
                the Taurides and are thought to be remnants of an oceanic upper plate below which oceanic lithosphere that

                separated Greater Adria from the North African margin in Paleozoic and Mesozoic time subducted in Late
                Cretaceous time (Mafﬁone et al., 2017; Moix et al., 2008). The Cyprus slab must contain this now subducted
                Cretaceous age upper plate oceanic lithosphere (e.g., Biryol et al., 2011; Mafﬁone et al., 2017; Moix et al.,
                2008). The objective of our study is to reconstruct the relationship between the Antalya slab and the
                NW-SE trending western Central Taurides fold-thrust belt; the Antalya Nappes were formed above another
                older and separate subduction zone, and so in our reconstruction we treat them as a single composite unit.
                Finally, in the central part of the composite fold-thrust belt, the Antalya Nappes and underlying Taurides are
                covered by the Miocene marine to marginal-marine Antalya basin, which includes the Aksu, Köprüçay, and
                Manavgat subbasins as well as the Gulf of Antalya (Figures 2 and 3). These subbasins contain a Burdigalian
                (~20–16 Ma) to lower Pliocene stratigraphy (~5–3 Ma; see Flecker et al., 2005; Çiner et al., 2008). The
                Antalya basin was deformed by thrust faults until at least early Pliocene time (Poisson et al., 2003). Koç
                et al. (2012, 2017) Koç, Kaymakci, et al. (2016) and Koç, van Hinsbergen, et al. (2016) demonstrated that
                Miocene thrusting was coeval with E-W extension in the Central Tauride intramontane basins (Figure 3)
                and accommodated westward convex oroclinal bending of the western Central Taurides.

                3. Cross Section Construction
                3.1. Methods
                We constructed a balanced cross section of the western Central Taurides fold-thrust belt from the Beydağları
                platform, NE across the NW-SE trending belt, to assess the timing and style of deformation and minimum
                shortening. In the absence of subsurface data, we constructed the cross section using dip data, observations
                of ﬁeld relationships, and lithostratigraphy. We interpreted thrust faults where there was structural repetition
                of the lithostratigraphy or footwall cutoff and hanging wall cutoff contacts. Faulting and folding on the scale of
                one hundred meters was not represented on our 144-km-long section, and so we collected dip measurements
                that were representative of the ﬁrst-order structures. The shape of a thrust fault ramp exerts a ﬁrst-order
                control on the style of deformation in the hanging wall above the fault (e.g., Berger & Johnson, 1980). We used
                surface constraints on hanging wall deformation to predict the position and shape of subsurface thrust faults.
                Thin-skinned fold-thrust belts evolve above a shallow dipping planar décollement (e.g., Dahlen, 1984; Davis
                et al., 1983). It was not possible to estimate the depth of the décollement using widely used area-depth
                calculation (e.g., Epard & Groshong, 1993), and we instead used the thickness of thrust sheets and predicted
                fault trajectories to estimate the depth of the décollement, which we explain further in section 3.3.
                At each step in building the cross section, we assumed the simplest structural solution with the least short-
                ening. Eroded hanging wall anticlines were reconstructed as close to the modern topographic surface as pos-
                sible using the geometric model of Suppe (1983). We assumed that that area was conserved during
                deformation and that deformation was accommodated by layer-parallel shear. In the absence of evidence,
                we assumed negligible footwall deformation and assumed that thrust faults formed instantaneously, rather
                than by propagation. Section balancing assumes plane strain, which may be violated if the section is cross-cut
                by strongly oblique faults or strike-slip faults. Strike-slip faults and oblique faults have been interpreted in the
                western Central Taurides (Akay & Uysal, 1988; Glover & Robertson, 1998), although lateral offset has never
                been demonstrated on any of the high-angle faults within our cross section.
                We balanced the section to test whether our structural interpretation was internally consistent and to calcu-
                late minimum shortening (e.g., Dahlstrom, 1969). A balanced cross section can be restored to its original, pre-
                deformation geometry with a near-perfect ﬁt of all structural units in their predeformation order. We restored
                the section by unfolding each thrust sheet relative to a local pin line (i.e., within the thrust sheet). Parts of the
                section with an unknown stratigraphy were balanced using arbitrary template beds, and in Figure 7 those
                parts have been left as white spaces. We used the ﬂexural-slip unfolding algorithm in Move 2016, which we
                benchmarked against the analytical method of Suppe (1983). Unfolding was imposed relative to a template
                horizon (i.e., the uppermost continuous stratigraphic horizon in the thrust sheet). The algorithm maintains
                area and also line length in lines that are parallel to the template horizon.
                3.2. Field Observations
                We found that the western Central Taurides developed as an overall west verging fold-thrust belt toward the
                Beydağları platform foreland. Our ﬁeld observations are presented as a strip map and cross section in
                Figure 4. Descriptions of our main ﬁeld observations are in Table 1, which is accompanied by photographs

 Bucak thrust                                      At Susuz, Upper Cretaceous limestone is thrust over Paleogene and (locally) upper Miocene rocks of the Beydağları
   Figures 5a and 5j                                 foreland. The overlying Upper Cretaceous rocks contain meter-scale bedded limestone that deﬁnes a west
   Figures 4a and 4b, point i)                       dipping monocline, which we interpret as a hanging wall anticline. The E-W trending valley at Susuz forms a
                                                     reentrant in the thrust contact and exposes 1–3 km of Paleogene rocks in the footwall. South of Susuz
                                                     (Figure 4a, point i), the Bucak thrust is downthrown on steep E-W trending faults and is covered by a thick
                                                     layer of unconsolidated sediments. The west dipping hanging wall anticline, however, is continuous along
                                                     strike to the line of the section. The hanging wall limestones dip ~20°W and are cut by a series of N-S
                                                     trending normal faults that juxtapose massive and thickly bedded limestones with uppermost Cretaceous
                                                     thinly bedded pelagic limestones.
 East limb Bucak anticline                         Along the eastern limb of the Bucak anticline, Upper Cretaceous and local Paleogene limestones are covered on
   Figures 4a and 4b, point ii)                      a ﬂat-on-ﬂat contact by a wide ridge of the Çataltepe nappe of the Antalya Nappes. The underlying rocks of the
                                                     Bucak anticline are exposed to the north and south of the ridge, indicating that at least for the ﬁrst few kilometers
                                                     the underlying limestone dips shallowly east. The Çataltepe nappe is exposed for about 5 km and then dips
                                                     below higher tectonostratigraphic units of the Antalya Nappes (Alakırçay nappe and Tahtalıdağ nappe).
 Aksu basin margin                                 Miocene sedimentary rocks are juxtaposed with the Antalya Nappes along 60–90°E dipping contact that we
   Figures 4a and 4b, point iii)                     interpret as a normal fault. This locally forms the basin margin of the Miocene Aksu basin. Elsewhere, the
 box B                                               Antalya Nappes are unconformably covered by gently folded (~10° dipping limbs) Miocene marine
   Figure 5b                                         sedimentary rocks of the Aksu basin.
 Aksu intrabasin thrusting                         On the strip map, the basin is dominated by a 600-m-high ridge of bedded lower Miocene conglomerate (Ciner
   Figures 4a and 4b, point iv)                      et al., 2008) that has been thrust over upper Miocene sandstone and marl. Within the conglomerate ridge, the
   Figure 5b                                         westernmost conglomerate unit dips ~20°E, followed by domains of ~50°E, then ~85°E on the eastern edge of
                                                     the ridge. Between the 20°E and ~50°E dipping domains we found upper Miocene sandstone and marl on top
                                                     of the conglomerate, which represents a thrust repetition. Between the ~50°and ~85°dipping domains we
                                                     found a conspicuous footwall cutoff with local drag folding indicating a thrust fault.
 Aksu thrust                                       The eastern margin of the Aksu basin is bound by a 60–80°E dipping Aksu thrust fault (e.g., Ciner et al., 2008),
   Figures 4a and 4b                                 which juxtaposes the Çataltepe and Alakırçay nappes of Antalya Nappes with Miocene rocks.
 Antalya Nappes                                    The Antalya Nappes east of Aksu form high relief ranges of up to 2,000 m in elevation and include all
 Haskızılören thrust                                 tectonostratigraphic units of the Antalya nappes. The ophiolitic Tekirova Nappe is preserved within a N-S
   Figures 4c and 4d, point v)                       trending syncline, bound to the east and west by exposures of lower tectonostratigraphic units of the
                                                     Antalya Nappes. The rocks within the Antalya Nappes are intensely deformed by faulting and folding. A large
                                                     part of that deformation must be related to the accretion of the Antalya Nappes nappe stack in Cretaceous
                                                     to Paleocene times. In some places, for example, near Haskızılören, Antalya Nappes rocks are thrust over
                                                     outliers of lower Miocene rocks, which require that part of the internal deformation is post early Miocene in age.
 Bozburundağ thrust                                At Haskızılören, the Alakırçay Nappe is overlain by vertically bedded upper Miocene conglomerates that dip
   Figure 3, Etler                                   onto a low-angle basal fault. This geometry is typical of a hanging wall cutoff but requires that younger rocks
   Figure 4c box C                                   thrust over older ones. The internal structure of the Bozburundağ hanging wall was observed from a distance
   Figure 5c                                         and has been imposed onto Section 4C. The conglomerates at Bozburundağ are the marginal facies of, and
                                                     interﬁnger with, the marine sedimentary rocks of the Miocene Köprüçay basin to the east (Ciner et al., 2008;
                                                     Deynoux et al., 2005). We consequently interpret this contact to be the result of inversion of an original basin-
                                                     bounding normal fault that thrusted marginal basin ﬁll over the footwall and the basin edge. At Etler, 10 km
                                                     south along the Bozburundağ fault, a normal fault contact is preserved and Miocene conglomerates in the
                                                     hanging wall are folded, suggesting that partial inversion affected the fault there.
 Bozburundağ anticline                             Upper Miocene conglomerates of Bozburundağ contain an intraformational angular unconformity and thin
   Figure 3, Yeşilvadi                               toward the east, where the Cretaceous age Geyikdağı platform emerges in a west dipping sequence. An
   Figure 4d, point vi)                              upward steepening of dips across the unconformities is consistent with our interpretation that the

 Observation                                                                                         Description

 Köprüçay Slump                                   In the south of the Köprüçay basin, middle and upper Miocene marl and sandstone form a major west verging
   Figure 5k                                         anticline with a subvertical west limb that runs along the larger Köprüçay synclinal axis. This vertical limb can
                                                     be traced N-S over ~20 km and gradually disappears north and southward. Interestingly, in the southern and
                                                     eastern part of the synclinal axis, the eastern ﬂat-lying limb abuts abruptly against subvertical basal
                                                     conglomerates of the Köprüçay basin. This angular relationship suggests a normal fault contact, but this
                                                     fault is located within the Miocene basin stratigraphy, between the competent basal conglomerates and
                                                     the weak marl-rich marine deposits of the basin ﬁll. We explain the major fold in the marl and sandstone
                                                     within the topographically lowest part of the Köprüçay syncline as a mega slump that formed during
                                                     folding of the underlying basement. We regard the formation of the slump to be evidence for timing of
                                                     the uplift of the basin margin. The normal fault between these deposits with the basal conglomerates
                                                     represents a slump scar that formed during the folding of the Köprüçay syncline. The subvertical eastern
                                                     limb of the Köprüçay syncline is widely interpreted as a right-lateral Kırkkavak strike-slip fault (Dumont &
                                                     Kerey, 1975) or a normal fault (Deynoux et al., 2005; Schildgen et al., 2012). The contact between the
                                                     Miocene and Triassic stratigraphy is not a fault but an unconformity, and we found no evidence for the
                                                     presence of a Kırkkavak fault other than the slump scar. Instead, this is the asymmetric Kırkkavak anticline
                                                     adjacent to the Köprüçay syncline. There are surfaces within the Miocene conglomerate units that contain
                                                     slickensides, which are likely a reﬂection of layer-parallel slip during folding. The vertical eastern margin of
                                                     the syncline did not form the Miocene basin margin, as marine upper Miocene deposits are found at
                                                     1,500-m elevation east of the Kırkkavak anticlinal hinge at Sarıalan (Schildgen et al., 2012).
 Cretaceous unconformity                          East of the Kırkkavak anticline, the rocks are dominated by the Geyikdağı and higher structural units of the
   Figure 4f, point vii)                             Taurides that contain a recognizable but laterally variable lithostratigraphy (Figure 6). The carbonates of
   Figure 6                                          the Geyikdağı unit are deformed by a thrust imbricate indicated by the repetition of the lithostratigraphy.
                                                     The eastern limb of the Kırkkavak anticline contains Jurassic to Cretaceous platform carbonate rocks that
                                                     create a syncline that preserves Upper Cretaceous rocks in the core toward the south. Toward the south of

                                                     carbonate series, suggesting a phase of uplift and erosion sometime prior to latest Cretaceous time.
 Başgölcűk thrust                                 The eastern limb of the syncline formed above an ~55°E dipping thrust fault at Başgölcűk that thrusted Lower
   Figure 5f                                         Jurassic limestone over a narrow exposure of Paleogene rocks along a footwall cutoff. Paleogene rocks below
   Figures 4e and 4f                                 the Başgölcűk thrust are overthrusted from the east by the ~65°W dipping Taşbaşından thrust along a
                                                     footwall cutoff. This thrust also cross-cuts the Başgölcűk thrust. The overriding thrust sheet contains
                                                     100-m-scale thrust repetitions that locally steepened the overlying bedding.
 Pinarbasi thrust                                 Near Pınarbası, a well-exposed thrust fault dipping ~50°E separates deformed mudstone and sandstone of the Eocene
   Figures 4e and 4f                                ﬂysch (Monod, 1977) that forms the highest stratigraphic unit of the Gembos thrust sheet from overlying fractured,

 Derebucak thrust                                 The Cretaceous limestone and dolomite of the Pinarbasi thrust sheet is overthrusted by Lower Jurassic
   Figures 4e and 4f                                limestones of the Derebucak thrust sheet along a ﬂat-on-ﬂat thrust contact that is locally cross-cut by small-
   Figure 5h                                        scale normal faults. Near the town of Derebucak, a conspicuous footwall cutoff between the underlying ~15°E
                                                    dipping Upper Cretaceous limestones and ~45°E dipping Lower Jurassic limestones of the Derebucak thrust
                                                    sheet is exposed in the valley side. At least 3.5 km of ﬂat-on-ﬂat overlap of the Lower Jurassic limestone on
                                                    Upper Cretaceous limestone was mapped.
 Derebucak H.W. anticline                         The Derebucak thrust sheet extends 100 km southward along the range, and at Üzümdere, the hanging wall
   Figure 3, Üzümdere                               anticline of the thrust sheet is preserved, limiting shortening on the thrust to ~7 km.
 Aladağ nappe                                     At Akçabellen, north of the section, the Aladağ nappe tapers out, and the ophiolite-bearing Bozkır Nappe lies
   Figure 3, Akçabellen                             directly on the Derebucak thrust sheet. The platform rocks of the Geyikdağı unit plunge below the
                                                    allochthonous Aladağ and Bozkır nappes at Derebucak.
 Aladağ H.W. anticline                            South of Derebucak, the edge of the Aladağ nappe is marked by overturned Upper Triassic to Upper Cretaceous
   Figure 3, Kuyucak                                rocks, which we interpret as a hanging wall anticline.
 Seydişehir anticline                             Geyikdağı unit rocks reemerge from below the Bozkır and Aladağ nappes in a 2,300-m-high ridge of west
   Figure 3                                         dipping Triassic to Eocene limestones. This ridge forms the eastern limb of the regional-scale Huğlu syncline
                                                    and western limb of the regional-scale Seydişehir anticline. Cambrian-Ordovician shale and limestone are
                                                    exposed in the Seydişehir valley below and form the core of the anticline. Tectonic windows through the
                                                    internally deformed shale expose Triassic rocks and therefore demonstrate that there is duplexing of the
                                                    Triassic and deeper stratigraphy in the anticline.
 Central Tauride intramontane                     East of Seydişehir, exposures of the Taurides become scarce owing to the overlying Mio-Pliocene
 extensional basins                                 ﬂuviolacustrine sedimentary rocks and volcanic rocks of the Central Tauride intramontane Basins (e.g., Koç
   Figure 2                                         et al., 2012). Within these Mio-Pliocene basins, inliers of metamorphic rocks of the Afyon zone (Bolkardağı)
                                                    and overlying ophiolite (e.g., Daşçı et al., 2015) are exposed, suggesting that the Taurides either
                                                    underthrusted or are absent below higher tectonostratigraphic units.

                and maps of key ﬁeld relationships in Figure 5. In Figure 6, we provide ﬁve schematic logs that illustrate the
                various formations present across the fold-thrust belt, following the formation deﬁnitions of Monod (1977).
                The thicknesses portrayed are measured in continuous sections in the ﬁeld or estimated from dip data. We
                found strong lateral variations in the presence, absence, and thickness of stratigraphic units compared to
                the composite stratigraphy of Monod (1977), which is in part the result of thrust tectonics and in part the
                result of erosional unconformities.


                3.3. Cross Section Results
                Our cross section successfully reconciles our ﬁeld observations into a viable structural model and keeps struc-
                tural relationships simple. The deformed and retrodeformed sections are shown in Figure 7, and a larger,
                more detailed version that shows lithostratigraphic constraints is available in the supporting information
                (Figure S2). Our section has a total length of 144 km, which becomes 234.5 km long when retrodeformed.
                This indicates a minimum of 90.5 km shortening since the onset of thrusting of the Aladağ and Bozkır nappes
                over the Geyikdağı unit in Eocene times. This total amount of shortening includes a minimum overlap of
                55 km of the Aladağ and Bozkır nappes over the Geyikdağı unit. We measure a minimum of 18 km shortening
                in the Derebucak thrust imbricate and 17.5 km in basement-involved thrusting of the Bucak thrust and the
                thrusting that deformed the Antalya basin.
                Our cross section starts in the Beydağları platform, which we describe as the foreland because it is the lowest
                structural unit (Figures 2a and 3), and is not deformed by thrust faults at the surface. We use dip data and the
                limited stratigraphic data to reconstruct the shape of the Bucak anticline. It is not possible to calculate the
                depth of the décollement using area-depth relationships, ﬁrst because we have no independent constraint
                on displacement on the Bucak anticline (Figures 4a and 4b) for a simple area-depth calculation and second
                because there is no mappable lithostratigraphy to constrain the fold shape in the Bucak anticline for use in an
                area-depth plot (e.g., Epard & Groshong, 1993). We face the same problem in the Seydişehir anticline
                (Figure 3) in the eastern hinterland part of the section. We solve this problem by using the shape of the hang-
                ing wall deformation of the Bucak anticline to predict the shape of the underlying fault and ﬁnd that a 10-km
                deep décollement recreates the wavelength of the anticline and gives a good ﬁt for the shape of the fold
                while minimizing shortening. We interpret this as the basal décollement of the belt. Our reconstruction
                requires that below the Bucak anticline, the décollement dips at 2°E to ﬁt the Taurides stratigraphy below
                the Antalya Nappes on the eastern side of the Bucak anticline. This is within 0.5° to 4° of typical
                décollement dips found in fold-thrust belts (e.g., Echavarria et al., 2003; McQuarrie, 2004; Mitra, 1988). We
                otherwise have no constraint on the depth and dip of the décollement, and so to the east of the Bucak
                anticline, we assume that it is subhorizontal to 1°E dipping, to minimize space above the décollement.
                We interpret that the Aksu basin (Figures 4a and 4b, iii) ﬁlled a graben because the western basin margin is
                most simply interpreted as a normal fault. After restoring shortening within the Aksu basin, we predict that
                the subsurface extension of eastern basin-bounding normal fault is located to the east of the Aksu thrust,
                below the current position of the Antalya Nappes. We interpret a series of east dipping thrust faults within
                the Aksu basin based on lithostratigraphic repetition and footwall cutoffs. The thrust sheets become system-
                atically steeper dipping toward the east, which we interpret as refolding caused by a foreland propagating
                thrust imbricate. The thrust imbricate incorporates a ~1-km thick stratigraphy and contains at least 15 km
                of shortening.
                Thrusting within the Aksu basin must link into the basal décollement to be balanced and is likely linked along
                the Bozburundağ thrust (Figures 4c and 4d), because the uppermost unit of the Antalya Nappes is preserved
                above the Aksu thrust, indicating the absence of a large fault-bend-fold anticline associated with a major
                thrust ramp. Our interpretation requires that the décollement at the base of the Antalya Nappes was reacti-
                vated as a thrust ﬂat connected to the Bozburundağ thrust and allowed the Antalya Nappes to bulldoze
                through the Aksu basin. We interpret that the Aksu fault was an in-sequence thrust relative to the
                Bozburundağ thrust, but out of sequence with respect to thrusting within the Aksu basin. We interpret that
                the Bozburundağ conglomerate (Figure 4c) was thrust over the Antalya Nappes along an inverted basin-
                bounding normal fault, which was folded by the underlying thrust fault. We reconstruct the shape of the
                thrust below Bozburundağ using the shape of the east dipping limb of the Bozburundağ anticline and the
                observation that to the west, the anticline remains buried below the Antalya Nappes that cover it.

                                          In the Köprüçay basin (Figure 5k), we assume based on the presence of angular unconformities exposed at
                                          both edges of the basin that the Miocene sedimentary rocks were deposited onto deeply incised and
                                          thrusted rocks that we saw near Kesme (Figure 3). We reconstruct the Kırkkavak anticline as an eroded and
                                          reactivated hanging wall anticline, which created steeply overturned Triassic rocks in the northern margin
                                          of the basin (Figure 7a). We attribute the tilt of the basin margin to folding in the hanging wall of thrust fault,
                                          which accommodated ~2 km of shortening by steepening of the fold limbs. We link the Kırkkavak thrust into
                                          the basal décollement to balance with thrusting to the west and to create uplift below the western edge of
                                          the Derebucak thrust imbricate. Uplift of the Kirkkavak anticline cannot be accounted for by Miocene
                                          deformation alone, suggesting that the anticline ﬁrst formed by thrusting during Eocene times.
                                          Thrust faults in the Derebucak area (Figure 3) form a thrust imbricate that does not include pre-Jurassic rocks
                                          as in the basement-involved thrust sheets to the west, and preserve the same structural level for ~20 km
                                          (Figures 4e, 4f, and 7a). We reconstruct the Derebucak thrust imbricate by assuming that the thrust faults sole
                                          into a single intermediate décollement at the base of the Jurassic platform carbonates. This is stratigraphically
                                          above the deep décollement we infer in thrusting to the west. We estimate an ~1.5-km-deep décollement
                                          using the stratigraphic thickness of the Derebucak thrust sheet (Figures 4e and 4f), as that thrust has a ﬂat-
                                          on-ﬂat relationship at its base. Mechanically, the Kasımlar formation mudstone at the base of the platform
                                          carbonates provided a glide surface (Figure 4), above which the thrust imbricate formed. The thrust fault
                                          shapes are reconstructed from dip data above footwall cutoffs and from the shapes of hanging wall anticli-
                                          nes. The resulting reconstruction is the simplest conﬁguration.
                                          The Bozkır nappes above the eastern edge of the Derebucak thrust imbricate are structurally complex and
                                          contain juxtaposed allochthonous units that change relative position along strike (Andrew & Robertson,
                                          2002). We choose not to differentiate the internal structure of these nappes and instead measure the overlap
                                          of the Bozkır and Aladağ nappes over the Geyikdağı unit. No evidence for shortening exists in the underlying
                                          platform rocks or along strike of the Huğlu syncline (Figure 3), where the allochthonous nappes have been
                                          eroded and the underlying platform rocks are exposed.

                                          the Derebucak thrust imbricate. We use the minimum shortening estimate obtained from the Derebucak
                                          thrust imbricate to reconstruct a hinterland-dipping thrust duplex that recreates the wavelength and
                                          amplitude of the Seydişehir anticline while balancing surface thrusting. Thick thrust sheets are required to
                                          ﬁll space below the Seydişehir anticline while maintaining a balance with the Derebucak thrust imbricate.
                                          This suggests that the basal décollement below the Derebucak thrust imbricate steps down into the same
                                          basal décollement level that we reconstruct for the thrust faulting in the west, which also minimizes
                                          structural complexity.

                                          4. Discussion
                                          The aim of our paper is to determine the composition and subduction history of the Antalya slab and its rela-
                                          tionship to the Cyprus slab through structural analysis of the Taurides fold-thrust belt. To this end, we develop
                                          the ﬁrst orogen-scale cross section across the western Central Taurides. Below, we discuss the validity of our
                                          section and shortening estimates and then discuss the temporal evolution of the fold-thrust belt. We then
                                          use this reconstruction to interpret the long-term subduction history and discuss the role these slabs may
                                          have played during Miocene surface uplift in southern Anatolia.

                                          4.1. Style of Deformation
                                          The western belt from the Beydağları platform foreland to Köprüçay basin has long wavelength (~15 km)
                                          folding and thrusting that involves deep structural units, including Precambrian rocks found north of the
                                          Köprüçay basin. The eastern belt incorporates the Derebucak thrust imbricate, the Seydişehir duplex, and
                                          the Bozkır and Aladağ nappes.
                                          In our structural model, we assum minimum shortening. Variation in the dip or depth of the décollement
                                          would inﬂuence our structural interpretation and the amount of shortening. For the basement-involved
                                          thrusting there is uncertainty in the subsurface structure because the full thickness of the thrust sheets is
                                          not present at the surface; we rely on the wavelength, amplitude, and shape of the fault related folding to

                                  Tectonics                                                      10.1029/2017TC004893



                estimate the depth to décollement. It is plausible that some of the basement-involved thrusts are inverted
                normal faults that penetrate down to midcrustal depths as in a thick-skinned thrust belt, although we did
                not observe a change in stratigraphic thicknesses from the footwall to the hanging wall that would support
                this. At Bucak, we use the shape of the Bucak anticline to predict the shape of the underlying fault and ﬁnd
                that a 10-km-deep décollement recreates the wavelength of the anticline and gives a good ﬁt for the shape of
                the fold. A shallower décollement, however, would be associated with thinner thrust sheets and would
                require extra shortening to ﬁll space beneath the Bucak anticline. We assume a subhorizontal dipping
                décollement to minimize space in the subsurface that needs to be ﬁlled by thrust repetition and hence short-
                ening. For a steeper décollement of 3° to 4°, space above a décollement in the hinterland would likely need to
                be ﬁlled by underthrusting of an eastward continuation of the Beydağları platform below the Derebucak
                thrust imbricate, requiring ~40-km extra shortening and essentially making the Geyikdağı unit an internally
                deformed allochthonous nappe. The deep décollement and thick thrust sheets we reconstruct for the
                Seydişehir duplex are necessary to ﬁll space beneath the Seydişehir anticline while balancing shortening in
                the Derebucak thrust imbricate.
                In the Derebucak thrust imbricate, only the Mesozoic stratigraphy is incorporated in the thrust sheets along
                the entire belt, the thrusts are closely spaced, and numerous examples of ﬂat-on-ﬂat or footwall cutoff rela-
                tionships demonstrate that the thrust sheets are only a few kilometers thick. Hanging wall and footwall cutoffs
                in the Derebucak thrust imbricate are preserved in most thrust slices and limit structural overlap, and so it is
                unlikely that thrusting there accommodated much more shortening than reconstructed. Our interpretation of
                the subsurface structure of the Derebucak thrust imbricate is subject to uncertainty. In the absence of seismic
                or drill-core constraints on the depth of the underlying intermediate décollement, a deeper or steeper
                décollement could accommodate more shortening, but would require a more complex structural model.
                Our reconstruction assumes the thrusts within the duplex in the Seydişehir anticline sole into the basal
                décollement to reduce complexity; the actual depth of the décollement that the duplex soles into is unknown.
                Approximately 55 km of the 73 km of shortening in the belt east of Kirkkavak is demonstrated by the overlap
                of the Bozkır and Aladağ nappes preserved as klippen on top of the Geyikdağı unit (Figure 7). A hanging wall
                cutoff exists for the Aladağ nappe just south of our section, suggesting that only the Bozkır nappes may have
                extended farther west and were removed by erosion. Our shortening estimate does not include internal
                deformation within the Aladağ and Bozkır nappes, which may have accommodated a large but unknown
                amount of extra shortening.
                The total amount of overlap of the Aladağ and Bozkır nappes over the Geyikdağı unit is unconstrained, and
                the thrust at the base of the Aladağ nappe may thus have accommodated a large amount of convergence
                before thrusting over the Geyikdağı nappe. Cretaceous deep-marine sedimentary rocks are reported at the
                base of the Aladağ nappes near the town of Hadim, 80 km to the southeast of Derebucak, and are interpreted
                as the remnants of a deep basin known as the Dipsiz Göl basin, which may have separated platforms that the
                Aladağ and Geyikdağı rocks originated from (Özgül, 1984; Mackintosh & Robertson, 2012). The consumption
                of the Dipsiz Göl basin may have accommodated a large amount of convergence with little or no
                accretionary record.

                4.2. Timing of Deformation
                The western Central Taurides formed in two main phases of thrusting. The early phase started with thrusting
                of the Bozkır Nappes over the Aladağ nappe in Late Cretaceous to Paleocene times, as constrained by upper-
                most Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) foreland basin deposits on top of the Aladağ nappe (Andrew & Robertson,
                2002; Özgül, 1997). The formation of the Derebucak thrust imbricate at the expense of the Geyikdağı unit
                occurred after late Lutetian time (~40 Ma), based on the youngest stratigraphic unit incorporated in the
                thrusting (Gutnic et al., 1979).
                Basement-involved thrusting to the west of the Derebucak thrust imbricate occurred largely in Neogene time
                but must have started prior to early Miocene deposition of the Köprüçay basin. This conclusion is required by
                the deep unconformity in the northern Köprüçay basin, the angular unconformity on the Kırkkavak anticline,
                and the reentrant in the Antalya Nappes exposed on Bozburundağ Mountain. The earliest stages of
                basement-involved thrusting between Kirkkavak and the Beydağları platform foreland must have predated
                deposition of Burdigalian sedimentary rocks (~20–16 Ma) that cover folds and thrusts beneath the

                Köprüçay Basin. Those structures may therefore be part of the Eocene phase of thrusting. Folding in the
                Köprüçay basin and thrusting in the Aksu basin incorporate sedimentary rocks up to Tortonian age (~12–
                7 Ma), and the soft-sediment deformation and slope failure in the middle-upper Miocene of the Köprüçay
                basin dates the formation of the Kırkkavak fold. Minor thrusting affected Pliocene marine sedimentary rocks
                (Poisson et al., 2003), whereas widespread Pleistocene tufa deposits of the Antalya Plain (Figure 3) are unde-
                formed (Glover, 1995). Thus, basement-involved thrusting between Kirkkavak and the Beydağları platform
                foreland started prior to the Burdigalian (~20 Ma) and continued until early Pliocene time. Whether there
                was a phase of tectonic quiescence between the late Eocene and early Miocene, or whether thrusting was
                continuous, is not known. The absence of upper Eocene or Oligocene sedimentary rocks throughout our sec-
                tion suggests that the thin-skinned thrusting of the Derebucak imbricate may have been conﬁned to the mid-
                dle Eocene and that the shortening occurred in two stages separated by a late Eocene to Oligocene period of
                tectonic quiescence.

                4.3. Relationship of Taurides Deformation With Antalya Slab Subduction
                Our cross section demonstrates that the western Central Taurides fold-thrust belt accommodated a minimum
                of 90.5 km of upper crustal shortening since the onset of middle Eocene thrusting of the Aladağ and Bozkır
                nappes over the Geyikdağı unit. Shortening in the fold-thrust belt must have led to northeastward displace-
                ment and deep underthrusting or subduction of the original crustal and mantle lithosphere underpinnings of
                nappes in the belt.
                The carbonate platform sedimentary facies and the long stratigraphic range from Precambrian to Eocene of
                the Geyikdağı unit suggest that it must have been underlain by continental crust that supported a surface
                elevation around sea level. Such continental crust, similar to that of the Seychelles today, is typically
                ~30 km thick (Hammond et al., 2013). Our cross section shows a thin-skinned fold-thrust belt that formed
                above a basal décollement at ~10-km depth (Figure 7). The estimated total crustal thickness, however, is
                ~35–40 km (Di Luccio & Pasyanos, 2007; Tezel et al., 2013), suggesting that another 15–30 km of crust exists
                below the décollement. The crust below the décollement must be connected to the Beydağları platform fore-
                land and may be underlain by its original mantle lithosphere.
                The continental subduction and upper crustal accretion that formed the western Central Taurides occurred
                between the converging Africa and Eurasia plates. To assess how much time it would require in late
                Eocene and younger time to accommodate 90.5 km of continental subduction in southern Turkey, we com-
                pared our shortening record to the amount of convergence through time calculated from an Africa-Eurasia
                plate circuit reconstructed from the Atlantic Ocean. Using the Seton et al. (2012) plate circuit, we calculated
                an average Africa-Eurasia convergence rate of approximately 2 cm per year (20 km/Ma) during Eocene time.
                This is a minimum estimate of the subduction rate because it assumes that no extension occurred in the over-
                riding Eurasian plate. This is, however, reasonable, because both the Black Sea and the extensional meta-
                morphic complex of Central Anatolia in which the Kırşehir Block and Afyon zones exhumed are pre-late
                Eocene in age (e.g., Okay et al., 1994; Gautier et al., 2008; Lefebvre et al., 2011; van Hinsbergen et al., 2016;
                Gurer et al., 2018). In addition, there is no evidence for major Eocene to early Miocene shortening to the north
                or northeast of our section. Using the Africa-Eurasia convergence rate as an estimate for subduction rate, it is
                evident that the shortening associated with the underthrusting of the Geyikdağı unit below the Aladağ and
                Bozkır Nappes and its internal imbrication prior to basement-involved thrusting between Kirkkavak and the
                Beydağları platform foreland would require as little as ~5 Myr of late Eocene subduction and may well have
                occurred entirely within the Lutetian (~49–41 Ma, Gradstein, 2012).
                This scenario poses the following question: Where was subduction accommodated before and after the
                accretion of the thin-skinned portion of the western Central Taurides? Several candidate structures exist that
                may have accommodated convergence prior to the underthrusting and internal imbrication of the Geyikdağı
                unit. First, we only constrain minimum shortening on the thrust fault below the Aladağ unit. The concentra-
                tion of thrusting in the Derebucak thrust imbricate and the apparent lack of deformation in the platform
                rocks that were once covered by the Bozkır and Aladağ nappes suggest that the allochthonous nappes were
                ﬁrst emplaced over the platform, and then in the latest stages of accretion, the thrust imbricate deformed
                ahead of the overriding allochthonous nappes. Wholesale underthrusting (i.e., convergence without shorten-
                ing) of an eastern continuation of the Geyikdağı unit below the Aladağ nappe may be hidden if no window in
                Central Anatolia exposes the Geyikdağı unit—and no such window has been found. In the equivalent part of

                the orogen in western Turkey, Miocene low angle normal faulting has exhumed a window that reveals
                stacked metasedimentary rocks of the Menderes Massif that may be the underthrusted northward continua-
                tion of the Beydağları platform, even though underthrusting there did not lead to major accretion at the
                thrust front in the Lycian Nappes (e.g., Collins & Robertson, 1998; Gessner et al., 2001; van Hinsbergen,
                2010). Metasedimentary rocks with peak metamorphic ages as young as late Eocene (~35 Ma) are exposed
                as far as 200 km north of the Lycian thrust front (e.g., Lips et al., 2001; Bozkurt et al., 2011; Schmidt et al.,
                2015), and internal shortening within the Menderes Massif (e.g., Gessner et al., 2001) may have accommo-
                dated hundreds of kilometers of shortening equivalent to all ~55- to 35-Ma Africa-Eurasia convergence
                (van Hinsbergen, Kaymakci, et al., 2010). The underthrusting without major accretion that is recorded in wes-
                tern Turkey may be analogous to the fate of the missing Paleocene and early Eocene accretionary record in
                the western Central Taurides. Furthermore, the enigmatic deep-marine deposits of the Dipsiz Göl basin
                (Özgül, 1984) found below the Aladağ thrust (Mackintosh & Robertson, 2012) may be a remnant of a deep
                basin once separating the Aladağ nappe and Geyikdağı unit, which was consumed by underthrusting with
                almost no accretionary record. In even earlier times, before the accretion of the Aladağ and Bolkardağı nappe
                (Afyon zone) in the Maastrichtian to Paleocene (Özgül, 1997), convergence was accommodated by under-
                thrusting below the ~95- to 90-Ma suprasubduction zone ophiolites and underlying mélange of the Bozkır
                nappes with no record of major accretion, but the development of a volcanic arc on the Kırşehir Block (van
                Hinsbergen et al., 2016, and references therein).
                Where subduction happened after the late Eocene accretion of the western Central Taurides is more proble-
                matic. After Lutetian times (~40 Ma), a further 450 km of Africa-Eurasia convergence must have been accom-
                modated according to the plate circuit. Our post-Lutetian estimate of the amount of shortening, probably
                conﬁned to the Neogene, accounts for less than 5% of convergence, and uncertainties in the depth of
                décollement do not allow for more than a few tens of kilometers more shortening. In addition, we know of
                no candidate thrust west of the Derebucak imbricate that may have accommodated hundreds of kilometers
                of subduction without accretion. It is most likely that post-Lutetian Africa-Eurasia convergence was accom-
                modated to the south of the Beydağları platform. This would require that by late Eocene time, the
                Beydağları platform foreland decoupled from the African plate and accreted to Anatolia.
                A similar conclusion was drawn from a ﬁrst-order structural transect of the Beydağları platform and Menderes
                Massif in western Anatolia. van Hinsbergen, Kaymakci, et al. (2010) argued that Africa-Eurasia convergence
                there was taken up by shortening in the Menderes Massif and Lycian Nappes until late Eocene time. No
                record of Oligocene thrusting exists in the Menderes massif, Lycian nappes, or its Beydağları platform fore-
                land, during which time hundreds of kilometers of Africa-Eurasia convergence must have occurred. van
                Hinsbergen, Kaymakci, et al. (2010) suggested that in late Eocene time (~35 Ma), the entire crust of the
                Beydağları-Menderes platform accreted to the overriding Anatolian lithosphere. The Eocene and older plate
                boundary was hence kinked and had two roughly E-W trending segments along which the Aegean and
                Cyprus slabs subducted and a connecting N(W)-S(E) trending segment where the Antalya slab subducted.
                After the Aegean trench jumped to the south of the Beydağları platform in late Eocene time, the Aegean
                and Cyprus trenches were directly connected along the Florence Rise (Figure 2a). In that scenario, the
                Beydağları platform, which was connected to the Antalya slab, was isolated in an intraplate, upper-plate posi-
                tion, where it remains today. This explains why there is no shortening record to account for major post-
                Eocene plate convergence along the line of our section: The NW-SE trending western Central Taurides likely
                no longer accommodated Africa-Eurasia convergence after late Eocene time.
                Did we constrain the subduction history and composition of the Antalya slab and its relation to the Cyprus
                slab? From the analysis above, it follows that the history of the western Central Taurides since Eocene time
                requires the consumption of at least 90.5 km of lower crust and lithosphere by underthrusting below the
                Anatolia. The Antalya slab is the straightforward candidate to contain this lithosphere. The length of the
                Antalya slab as suggested by seismic tomography (Biryol et al., 2011; van der Meer et al., 2018) is at least
                300 km, at which point it becomes indistinguishable from the Cyprus slab in the tomography. The length
                of the slab requires that it contains not only the middle Eocene and younger lithosphere but also lithosphere
                that was consumed prior to underthrusting and accretion of the Geyikdağı unit, perhaps as far back as Late
                Cretaceous time. Subduction since Late Cretaceous time led to the accretion of continent-derived crustal
                units, and so the Antalya slab consists mostly of continental lithosphere. Presumably the net density of the
                slab was similar to that of the surrounding asthenospheric mantle, and so it did not break off shortly after

                Eocene time. Moreover, our analysis suggests that the Antalya slab is continuous with the Beydağları platform
                and has not been connected to the African plate since late Eocene time. The Cyprus slab appears to be con-
                tinuous with the African plate and must contain the oceanic lithosphere that separated Greater Adria from
                Africa, which according to plate reconstructions was 500 km wide and subducted after middle Eocene time
                (Mafﬁone et al., 2017; Moix et al., 2008). The upper mantle portions of the slabs are of different composition,
                continental in the case of the Antalya slab and oceanic in the case of the Cyprus slab, and have been discon-
                nected since middle Eocene time.
                Our results call for a reassessment of the dynamics of the Miocene tectonic evolution and uplift history of the
                western Central Taurides. Segmentation of slabs below Anatolia may have played a role in uplift of the
                Central Anatolian Plateau in the last 8 Ma by allowing mantle upwelling between slab segments
                (Schildgen et al., 2012). The timing of uplift requires late Miocene segmentation of the slabs. Koç, van
                Hinsbergen, et al. (2016) and Koç, Kaymakci, et al. (2016) suggested that Miocene extensional deformation
                of the Central Tauride intramontane basins, westward convex western Central Taurides oroclinal bending,
                and Miocene E-W shortening in the western Central Taurides were collectively driven by westward roll-
                back of the Antalya slab segment. Our analysis now shows that the Antalya slab has been decoupled from
                the Cyprus slab and evolved separately from the east Aegean slab for at least the last 35 Myr. We there-
                fore conclude that slab segmentation did not trigger uplift. This does not necessarily mean that the pre-
                vious hypotheses of Schildgen et al. (2012) and Koç, van Hinsbergen, et al. (2016); Koç, Kaymakci, et al.
                (2016) are falsiﬁed: slow westward rollback of the continental Antalya slab associated with early
                Miocene deformation may have opened a window between the slabs allowing asthenospheric inﬂow in
                late Miocene time. The detachment of the eastern Aegean slab below western Anatolia, which may have
                occurred around 15 Ma (Bocchini et al., 2018; van Hinsbergen, Kaymakci, et al., 2010) likely also inﬂuenced
                the dynamics of the Antalya and Cyprus slabs and promoted mantle ﬂow. To advance our understanding
                of the role of these slabs in driving Anatolian crustal deformation and surface uplift, we foresee that
                further analysis is needed on the late Eocene to recent history of the Antalya slab, through map view
                restoration and denudation history of the western Central Taurides, to explain why these processes
                started only in Miocene time and to ﬁnd the dynamic underpinnings of the enigmatic rise of the
                Central Anatolian Plateau.


                5. Conclusions
                In this paper, we study the history of shortening that led to the formation of the western Central Taurides to
                reconstruct the composition and subduction history of the Antalya slab in relation to the Cyprus slab under-
                lying Central Anatolia. Our conclusions are summarized as follows:
                • We present the ﬁrst balanced, kinematically viable model of the structure of the western Central Taurides
                  and ﬁnd a minimum of 90.5 km of shortening in a thin-skinned fold-thrust belt. We identify and describe
                  two décollement horizons and a two-stage evolution of the belt, associated with different structural styles.
                • In an early deformation phase, shortening led to emplacement of the Bozkır and Aladağ nappes onto the
                  Geyikdağı unit. Emplacement of these nappes was followed by formation of a thin-skinned fold-thrust belt
                  from Kırkkavak to Seydişehir, east of which the décollement stepped down from ~1.5 km to ~10 km depth.
                  The fold-thrust belt between Kırkkavak and Seydişehir formed until at least late Lutetian time (~40 Ma) and
                  accommodated at least 73 km of Eocene shortening.
                • The later deformation phase refolded the western part of the belt and created long (~15 km) wavelength
                  folding and thrusting, caused by basement-involved thin-skinned thrusting that propagated the ~10 km
                  décollement westward toward the Beydağları platform foreland. This later deformation phase must have
                  been active since at least Burdigalian times (~20 Ma), until at least early Pliocene times, and accommo-
                  dated a minimum of 17.5 km of shortening.
                • Comparison of our shortening estimates with expected subduction rates calculated from a plate circuit
                  model shows that even with the uncertainties associated with our model, there are hundreds of kilometers
                  of Africa-Eurasia convergence that left no accretionary record in the western Central Taurides. Pre-Eocene
                  convergence left a highly incomplete shortening record.
                • After Eocene times, Africa-Eurasia convergence in this segment of the plate boundary must have been
                  accommodated to the south of the Beydağları platform foreland, indicating that after late Eocene times,

                                                the Beydağları platform was decoupled from Africa and amalgamated to the overriding plate. The Antalya
                                                slab underlying the Beydağları platform may still be attached to the Beydağları lithosphere and has
                                                remained almost stagnant since Eocene times. The Miocene shortening phase was likely dynamically dri-
                                                ven by the Antalya slab, but how remains enigmatic
                                              • We suggest that the Antalya slab consists largely of continental lithosphere, in contrast to the Cyprus slab,
                                                which must consist largely of oceanic lithosphere. These two slabs were segmented since Eocene times,
                                                and so the process of segmentation was thus not a driver of Central Anatolian Plateau rise.

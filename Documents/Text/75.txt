We studied Cenozoic sedimentary rocks in the NE Ebro foreland Basin using the Anisotropy of Magnetic
Susceptibility (AMS) as a proxy for grain preferred orientation. Our new data, in combination with existing
results, reveal that penetrative strain by layer-parallel shortening extends well beyond the Pyrenean thrust-wedge
front into the Ebro foreland Basin, challenging the concept of the location of “deformation front” in the Southern
Pyrenees. Penetrative strain, as revealed by the magnetic fabrics, seems to reach larger distances into the Ebro
foreland Basin where stiffer layers constitute the main detachment level, whereas to the East strain dissipates
closer to the deformation front when the detachment is mostly due to salt deposits.

I fabric is essentially a compaction, sedimentary fabric with Kmin axes normal to the deposition plane and Kmax axes scatter along it. Type II (a and b) fabric
reveals the imprint of the first lateral shortening on the initial sedimentary fabric where both the Layer Parallel Shortening (LPS) or flattening plane and
depositional plane compete to define the total magnetic fabric. Kmax axes parallel the intersection direction between these two planes. Kmin axes eventually
show a girdle that is parallel to the maximum shortening direction. Ultimately Kmin axes become parallel to the shortening direction and Kmax axes remain
parallel to the intersection direction and not necessarily to the maximum extension direction (Type III). Rocks deformed by layer-parallel shearing, Types
IIa and IIb ellipsoids show a girdle of Kmin axes that are plunging away from the tectonic extension direction.

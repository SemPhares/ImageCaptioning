Deep Injection of Waste Water in the Western
Canada Sedimentary Basin
by Grant Ferguson




   Abstract
        Injection of wastes into the deep subsurface has become a contentious issue, particularly in emerging regions
   of oil and gas production. Experience in other regions suggests that injection is an effective waste management
   practice and that widespread environmental damage is unlikely. Over the past several decades, 23 km3 of water
   has been injected into the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). The oil and gas industry has injected
   most of this water but large amounts of injection are associated with mining activities. The amount of water
   injected into this basin during the past century is 2 to 3 orders magnitude greater than natural recharge to deep
   formations in the WCSB. Despite this large-scale disturbance to the hydrogeological system, there have been few
   documented cases of environmental problems related to injection wells. Deep injection of waste appears to be a
   low risk activity based on this experience but monitoring efforts are insufficient to make definitive statements.
   Serious uncharacterized legacy issues could be present. Initiating more comprehensive monitoring and research
   programs on the effects of injection in the WCSB could provide insight into the risks associated with injection in
   less developed sedimentary basins.

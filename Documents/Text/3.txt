Keywords:                                                  The present work focuses on the comprehension of the growth mechanisms and dimensional properties of the
Syn-sedimentary faults                                     pre-Pliocene Monte Alpi fault network by mean of integrated ﬁeld and laboratory analyses. After this multi-
Orthogonal fault system                                    disciplinary approach, detailed throw proﬁles are computed for each fault belonging to the Monte Alpi network.

Results of fault analysis performed on the 27 faults used for the 3D geological reconstruction. The 75, 50, and 25 percentile distributions of both dip azimuth and dip
angle computed for the individual faults are shown, respectively. The two main clusters of dip azimuth values are computed on the basis of the obtained histograms
(ie. Fig. 10b), in order to decipher the possible horizontal veering of the modelled 3D fault surfaces. In fact, the amount of strike variation reported in the last column
is related to the diﬀerence between the two clusters computed, along a horizontal plane, for each modelled fault.

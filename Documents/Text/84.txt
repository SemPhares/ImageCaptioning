    The shale was further divided into three types, i.e. siliciclastic,
dolomitic and silty shale based on the mineralogy compositions
and grain sizes (Fig. 5). The siliciclastic shale mainly consisted of
quartz, plagioclase and clay minerals with a few carbonates and
pyrites. The average percentages of quartz, plagioclase, clay mi-
nerals and carbonates were 32.3%, 30.2%, 17.4% and 12.3% for sili-
ciclastic shale. The dolomitic shale contained dolomites that ac-
counted for 32% of the compositions. The concentrations of quartz,
plagioclase and clay minerals in the dolomitic shale were reduced
to 25%, 25.6% and 9.8%, respectively. The silty shale had consistent
mineral compositions and contents generally with the siliciclastic
shale. However, the detrital grain (quartz and feldspar) sizes of the                                    Fig. 5. Mineral percentages of the main lithologies.

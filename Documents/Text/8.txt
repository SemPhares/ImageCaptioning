[1] The Sainte-Victoire System (SVS) is a key area to understand how the shortening
is accommodated in outer foreland of the Pyrenean-Provence orogen between Late
Cretaceous and Eocene. Structural data, growth strata and fault slip analysis, and four
balanced cross sections are used to decipher the along-strike geometry, deformational
characteristics and kinematics of the SVS. The SVS is divided into two structural
domains separated by a regional relay zone: the eastern domain is governed by a N-vergent
thin-skinned tectonic style above Triassic series and the western domain, by a mixed
S-vergent thick- and thin-skinned tectonic style with tectonic inversion of Late
Paleozoic-Triassic half grabens. Growth strata indicate that the eastern SVS grew during
Danian as a result of shortening transfer from the southern Arc Basin. In contrast, the
western SVS is an independent structure which has recorded the early stage (83 Ma)
of shortening and focused continuous deformation during 40 Myr. The shallow N-S
shortening is 5 km (25%) and 8 km (34%) in the western and eastern SVS,
respectively. At a regional scale, the tectonic inversion of the SVS and the Arc Basin
recorded a deep shortening of the order of 15‚Äì18 km (34%). Although the shortening
magnitude of the SVS remains small, other structures similar to the SVS were
synchronously active across foreland basin, suggesting a significant amount of cumulated
shortening. This outer foreland shortening may account for a non-negligible amount
of deformation at the Pyrenean-Provence orogen scale.

         tonic style with poorly reactivated basement faults. In contrast, the area located to the east shows a pro-
         nounced thick-skinned tectonic style. Present-day seismic events [Cushing et al., 2007], related to the
         Alpine compression, are approximately located at similar depths on both sides of the Middle Durance
         fault, suggesting active thin-skinned thrusting to the west and basement thrusting to the east. This
         along-strike contrasted tectonic style may result from heterogeneity in terms of thickness in the Mesozoic-

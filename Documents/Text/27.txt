  Abstract

      The drastic climatic changes which characterise the cooling trend of the last few million years of Earth history led to variations
  in eustatic sea level that had tremendous impact on the geology and ecology of continental margins. Reconstructing a sea-level
  curve back in time is not an easy task. Observations of shoreline positions are always a local measurement of Relative Sea Level
  that needs to be corrected from the effect of tectonic and thermal subsidence, sediment loading, compaction and glacio-hydro
  isostasy. Extensive studies have been done for the last deglaciation and for the last 100,000 yr cycle. But very few studies deal with
  position of sea level during earlier cycles, simply because conditions are very rarely favourable for the preservation of such
  witnesses. The shelf of the Golfe du Lion (Western Mediterranean) reveals a unique record of shoreline paleopositions during
  glacial maxima of at least the last five circa 100 kyr glacial/interglacial cycles. In fact it is the entire glacial deltaic lobe of up to
  50 m thick (from delta front or shoreface to prodelta) that has been preserved in place and which provides direct and independent
  constraints for relative sea-level minima. We measure a relative sea level of: − 112m, −128, − 134, −246 and −262 m for MIS 2, 6,
  8, 10 and 12 respectively. After corrections taking into account postdepositional movement of strata (subsidence), we find, that sea
  level dropped to a depth of − 102 ± 6 m during the last three glaciations (MIS2, MIS6, MIS8) but reached exceptionally low values
  of more than −150 ± 10 m during the preceding glaciations MIS10 and MIS 12 at about 340 and 434 kyr BP. This general time
  framework and sedimentological interpretation has been confirmed by preliminary results from two deep drillings during the
  PROMESS cruise (july 2004), which validate our methodology. However, no detailed and absolute datings of such witnesses are
  available so far, so that we cannot prove that these levels are the lowest ever reached during each glacials, but they correspond
  undoubtedly to the last preserved shoreface before rapid sea-level rise. We also suggest that the abrupt change in sea-level maxima
  might be the overprint of 400 kyr orbital periodicity cycles. Last but not least, these results prove that the Golfe du Lion is indeed a
  unique laboratory to study paleoclimates and sea-level variations on a larger time scale. Further work is needed for a complete

on the middle shelf of the Gulf, the depositional profile of deltaic sediments consists of a sandy prism PII (the shoreline) that evolves seaward to a silty
prism PI (offshore deposits), both deposited during t1 and therefore called PII-t1 and PI-t1. Sea-level drops during MIS2 (t2), and induces intense
erosion on the shelf that completely erases prism PII-t1, further on the outer shelf a new prism PII-t2 and PI-t2 is deposited. Sea level rises rapidly
during MIS1 (t3), and reworks previously deposited sediments on top of PI-t1 and PII-t2. So, the final sedimentary motif preserved is a triplet PI/PII/
PIII capped by a major erosional surface (in red). Note, that PIII is often absent in older sequences, because of erosion during subsequent lowering of
sea level in the next sequence. This scenario has been fully described in Rabineau et al. [54], using evidence from lithology, palynology,
micropaleontology, radiocarbon datings from 21 cores sampling the last sequence S5 together with seismic stratigraphy and numerical stratigraphic
modelling core analysis.

made up of sands (PII); in green dunes made up of reworked sand (PIII). The paired prisms PI–PII + (PIII) (blue-orange + green) form the sedimentary motif
that repeats itself. The Major discontinuities are in red between sequences. On the profile in A) two sequences (S4 and S5) are clearly identified with the
paired prisms PI–PII (blue-orange). But prism PII of S5 and prism PII of S4 have different geometries. Prism PII of S5 is less than 10 m thick on its outer
limit and this step is not so steep. We interpret this geometry as due to erosion of PII in this area (probably submarine erosion during transgression). On the
contrary, PII of S4 is thick (reaching 40 m) with a very steep step and very well defined and preserved sigmoïde shape. Here, prism PII has not been eroded.
On the profile in B) the five sequences are identified. In this area, prism PII of S5 is very well preserved from erosion, its top and outer limit represents the

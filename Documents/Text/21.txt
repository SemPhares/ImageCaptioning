            THE THERMAL GRADIENT HISTORY OF
            THE THRACE BASIN, NW TURKEY:
            CORRELATION WITH BASIN EVOLUTION PROCESSES

            O. Huvaz1* N. Karahanoglu2 and V. Ediger3

                 Thermal maturity modelling is widely used in basin modelling to help assess the exploration
            risk. Of the calibration algorithms available, the Easy%Ro model has gained wide acceptance. In
            this study, thermal gradients at 70 wells in the Thrace Basin, NW Turkey, were calibrated against
            vitrinite reflectance (%Ro) using the Easy%Ro model combined with an inverse scheme.The mean
            squared residual (MSR) was used as a quantitative measure of mismatch between the modelled
            and measured %Ro. A 90% confidence interval was constructed on the mean of squared residuals
            to assess uncertainty. The best thermal gradient (i.e. minimum MSR) was obtained from the MSR
            curve for each well, and an average palaeo-thermal gradient map of the Thrace Basin was therefore
            created. Calculated thermal gradients were compared to the results of previous studies. A comparison
            of modelled palaeo-thermal gradients with those measured at the present day showed that the
            thermal regime of the Thrace Basin has not changed significantly during the basin’s history.
                 The geological and thermal characteristics of the Thrace Basin were compared and the thermal
            anomalies were evaluated as a function of basin evolution processes. The basin’s thermal regime
            was controlled by: (1) basement edge effects; (2) crustal thickness and basement heat flows; (3)
            thermal conductivity variations within the stratigraphic column; (4) transient heat flow effects; and
            (5) the influence of tectonic features. The impact of these factors on variations in the thermal
            gradients is discussed in detail.
                 Basement edge effects are most marked on the steep northern margin of the basin where
            heat is preferentially retained in highly conductive basement rocks rather than being transferred
            into less conductive sedimentary rocks. Thus, heat is significantly focused onto the northern edge
            of the basement, resulting in a thermal anomaly along the northern basin margin.
                 The margins of the basin, with relatively thick upper crust, have relatively higher thermal
            gradients compared to the central areas. This is due to radiogenic heat production in the upper
            crust. Thus, thermal gradients increase above highs and at the margins where thicker upper crust
            is present. A heat flow map of the Thrace Basin, constructed using a basin-scale crustal thickness
            map and a basement heat-flow algorithm, is presented and demonstrates the heat generation
            potential of the upper crust.
                 The Eocene Ceylan Formation, which has relatively low thermal conductivity, significantly reduces
            the thermal gradients by blocking heat transferred from the basement. Areas of high sedimentation
            rate are associated with low thermal gradients due to the transient heat flow effects of young,
            thick and “thermally immature” sediments as a function of the heat capacities of these deposits.
                 A direct relationship between thermal gradients and major structural trends could not be
            established because of a number of factors including the inactivity of the subsurface Miocene fault

the applied maturity model, records the best
thermal gradients for each well (33 °C/km for
Degirmencik-3; and 40 °C/km for Yunus-1); this
corresponds to the minimum departure of the
modelled maturity profile from the measured one.
Statistical assessment of uncertainties are
performed using a 90% confidence interval,
constructed on the mean, which enables
determination of an uncertainty range for each of
the modelled wells. The uncertainty is related to the
scatter of the calibration data and the model
parameters. Well locations are shown on Fig. 3. (CI:

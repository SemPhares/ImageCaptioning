2.5. Three-dimensional displacement variation on single faults

in complex networks where mutual intersection is the general rule,

nearly all the millions of faults in this system occur at or close the
regionally correlative Middle Miocene unconformity, this latter
view is more likely correct. The widely observed restriction of most
faults in many different PFS to a single stratigraphic horizon argues
strongly that the upper limit of many tiers is in fact the time line at
which the system became inactive. It is an important observation
for fault genesis therefore that many PFS die out synchronously
over a large area. This suggests that there is a control on the growth
mechanism that can cease abruptly on a regional scale.
    More recently the debate over their genesis has intensiﬁed
(Cartwright and Dewhurst, 1998; Watterson et al., 2000; Goulty,
2002, 2008; Cartwright et al., 2003; Goulty and Swarbrick, 2005;
James et al., 2006). Some studies have found evidence that
appears to support the earlier ideas of density inversion as a driver
for polygonal faulting (Watterson et al., 2000; Nicol et al., 2003). In
contrast, Cartwright and Dewhurst (1998) compiled evidence from
a global review of PFS that pointed to the small particle sizes of host
sediments for PFS as a critical factor in their distribution. From this,
they argued that polygonal faulting was the result of syneresis,                               Figure 15. Seismic proﬁle from the Faeroe-Shetland Basin, showing how tier structure

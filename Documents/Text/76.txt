                  A tectonostratigraphic model for the evolution of rift basins has been built, involving three
                  distinct stages of basin development separated by key unconformities or unconformity
                  complexes. The architecture and signature of the sediment infill for each stage are discussed,
                  with reference to the northern North Sea palaeorift system. The proto-rift stage describes the rift
                  onset with either doming or flexural subsidence. In the case of early doming, a proto-rift
                  unconformity separates this stage from the subsequent main rift stage. Active stretching and
                  rotation of fault blocks during the rift stage is terminated by the development of the syn-rift
                  unconformity. Where crustal separation is accomplished, a break-up unconformity commonly
                  marks the boundary to the overlying thermal relaxation or post-rift stage. Tabular architectures,
                  thickening across relatively steep faults, characterize the proto-rift stage. Syn-rift architectures
                  are much more variable. Depending on the ability of the sediment supply to fill the waxing and
                  waning accommodation created during rotation and subsidence, one-, two- or three-fold
                  lithosome architectures are likely to develop. During the post-rift stage, an early phase with
                  coarse clastic infilling of remnant rift topography often precedes late stage widening of the basin
                  and filling with fine-grained sediments.

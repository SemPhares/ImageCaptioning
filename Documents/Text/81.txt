The recognition of seismically induced soft-sediment deformation structures (SSDS) in sedimentary successions
characterized by different facies, and hence by different rheology, is challenging. This is the case for high porosity
and high permeability aeolian facies interbedded with muddy wet interdune deposits and alluvial conglomerates
and sandstones. Several types of SSDS have been studied in two exposures of the Upper Pliocene (2.9–2.6 Ma)
sediments of a fault-bounded intracontinental aeolian dune ﬁeld in the Teruel Basin (Iberian Chain, eastern
Spain). Among SSDS, load and ﬂuid-escape structures, apart from several animal tracks, have been recognized.
Those structures show an irregular distribution through the studied stratigraphic sections, being scarce in ho-
mogenous aeolian sands and frequent in water-related facies. A detailed study of the distribution and geometry
of SSDS and their relationships with respect to the stratigraphic architecture and facies has allowed a critical dis-
crimination of trigger mechanisms, i.e. biological or physical overloading vs. earthquakes. The seismically in-
duced structures are concentrated into seven deformed beds, showing an uneven lateral distribution and
geometry closely controlled by the hosting sedimentary facies and their rheology. These seismites resulted
from liquefaction during moderate earthquakes (estimated magnitude from 5.0 to 6.8). The most probable
seismogenic source was the Sierra del Pobo normal fault zone, located 2 km to the East. Results show how an ap-
propriate recognition of sedimentary facies is crucial to understand the lateral variability of seismites in sedimen-
tary environments characterized by sharp facies changes.

D2 deformation is expected to occur diachronously in the foreland of the propagating accretionary wedge (vertical hatching), and follows shortly the NNW- to NW-ward
propagation of the ﬂexural basin (Section 4). It corresponds to the continental subduction stage, and it reached the Pelvoux area around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. The
D3 collision stage overprinted completely the previous orogenic wedge, which was indented westwards by the Internal metamorphic nappes stack (horizontal hatching),
giving birth to the western Alpine arc (Section 5). This overprint is shown by interference structures, deformation and uplift of the previously emplaced, low metamorphic
grade nappes (EN, vertical hatching), whose erosion feeded the molasse basins together with metamorphic rocks issued from the exhuming paleo-accretionnary wedge (IN).

Eocene, the Western Adria Transform Zone (WATZ) bounded a NW-dipping subduction zone beneath Corsica-Sardinia-Calabria, from a SE-dipping zone beneath Adria. The
continentward propagation of this transform zone allowed the Briançonnais terrane to be separated from the Iberian plate and integrated in the Alpine accretionnary prism,
the Adriatic crust and upper mantle therefore overlying the European crust. From Early Oligocene onwards, the northern part of Adria rotated and moved westwards. The

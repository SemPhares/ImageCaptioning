                                            However, more recent geologic studies throughout the Tibetan Plateau have challenged both of these
                                            assumptions. First, it is now widely accepted that the southern margin of Eurasia was deformed and elevated
                                            prior to collision, and thus, not all of the crustal thickening in Eurasia can be attributed to continental collision
                                            [Burg et al., 1983; Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al., 2007a; Ding et al., 2014]. Second, crustal shortening occurred
                                            near the modern northern boundary of the orogen close to the time of collision [Yin et al., 2002; Clark et al.,
                                            2010; Duvall et al., 2011]. This challenges the notion of a simple, northward propagating deformation front
                                            analogous to typical fold and thrust belt formation [Kong et al., 1997; Dayem et al., 2009; Clark et al., 2010;

                                            Mesozoic and early Cenozoic crustal shortening and only modest crustal shortening since ~50 Ma [Burg et al.,
                                            1983; Chang et al., 1986; England and Searle, 1986; Dewey et al., 1988, 1989; Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al.,

                                            the timing of initial continental collision between India and Eurasia, most estimates range between ~60 and

                     Cenozoic crustal shortening and high-altitude paleoelevations suggests that precollisional uplift and defor-
                     mation spanned from the Gangdese retroarc thrust belt, located just north of the Indus-Yarlung Suture,
                     northward to the Tanggula Shan (Figures 1 and 2) [Burg et al., 1983; Chang et al., 1986; England and Searle,
                     1986; Dewey et al., 1988, 1989; Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al., 2003, 2005, 2007a, 2007b; DeCelles et al.,
                     2007b; Volkmer et al., 2007, 2014; Miao et al., 2015]. Currently, this region is roughly 500–600 km in north-
                     south extent and encompasses ~45–50% of the modern width of the Tibetan Plateau, indicating that the high
                     plateau has roughly doubled in area since the onset of collision [Rowley, 1996, 1998; Dupont-Nivet et al., 2010;
                     Najman et al., 2010]. Several similarities can be drawn between the precollisional tectonic setting of the
                     Tibetan Plateau and of the modern Altiplano-Puna Plateau [England and Searle, 1986; Kapp et al., 2005;
                     Lippert et al., 2014], where eastward subduction of the Nazca Plate has resulted in thickened South
                     American lithosphere and an associated high-elevation mountain belt and plateau (Figure 2). While there
                     are certainly some differences, we ﬁnd that the modern central Andes may serve as an analogue for the early
                     evolutionary stages of Tibetan Plateau. Evidence for how Tibet evolved from an Andean-type margin to its
                     present elevation and spatial extent is most likely found north of the extent of precollisional deformation
                     and uplift, in the northern Tibetan Plateau.
                     Compared to the tectonic evolution of the Himalaya and the southern and central Tibetan Plateau, the defor-
                     mation history of the northern Tibetan Plateau is signiﬁcantly less well understood. Recent work along much
                     of the modern northern and northeastern plateau margin, in the Kunlun Shan, Qimen Tagh, and Qilian Shan,
                     argues for the initiation of crustal shortening and exhumation during or soon after the onset of collision,
                     which suggests that the northern boundary of the plateau has remained relatively ﬁxed since collision
                     [Kong et al., 1997; Yin et al., 2002; Clark et al., 2010; Duvall et al., 2011]. Aside from the relatively well
                     constrained onset of deformation at the northern boundary, the spatial and temporal pattern of deformation
                     across much of the remainder of the northern plateau interior is unclear (between the Tanggula Shan and
                     Kunlun Shan; Figure 1). Potential deformation scenarios include (a) synchronous distributed crustal shorten-
                     ing throughout the northern plateau near the onset of collision [Clark, 2012], (b) a northward propagating
                     deformation front within the northern Tibetan Plateau [Wang et al., 2008], or (c) the concentration of crustal
                     shortening along the northern plateau boundary at the onset of collision due to rheological heterogeneity,
                     followed by shortening of the remainder of the northern Tibetan Plateau at a later time [Kong et al., 1997;
                     Dayem et al., 2009].

Figure 2. Comparison of schematic cross sections of (top) the precollisional Tibetan Plateau and (bottom) the modern Andes. The cross section for the Tibetan Plateau was
constructed based on cross sections of the Gangdese retroarc thrust belt [Kapp et al., 2007b], the Nima Basin [Kapp et al., 2007a], the Qiangtang Anticlinorium [Kapp et al.,
2005], the Tanggula Shan [Li et al., 2012], and isopach data from the Hoh Xil Basin [Liu et al., 2001]. The yellow shaded region above the deformed Lhasa terrane represents the
relatively undeformed Linzizong volcanic cover. The mantle lithosphere shown beneath the Songpan-Ganzi and Qiangtang terranes is based on modern geophysical data
[Owens and Zandt, 1997] and is speculative. The Andean cross section is modiﬁed from McQuarrie et al. [2005] and is taken as an east-west transect across central Bolivia.


                                            An ideal place to evaluate these possible scenarios of northern Tibetan Plateau deformation and uplift is the
                                            Hoh Xil Basin (Figure 1). This basin contains strata that span Late Cretaceous to Miocene time and which
                                            record the precollisional and postcollisional deformational history of the northern Tibetan Plateau [Chang
                                            et al., 1986; Coward et al., 1988; Dewey et al., 1988; Kidd et al., 1988; Leeder et al., 1988; Liu et al., 2001, 2003;

                     thrust belt (FFTB), located in the central Hoh Xil Basin, using new constraints from 40Ar/39Ar dating of fault
                     gouge and low-temperature thermochronologic data, geologic mapping, and a balanced cross section. The
                     magnitude of deformation is estimated by balancing a structural cross section across the thrust belt based
                     on new geologic mapping, isopach data [Liu et al., 2001], and supplemented with previously published geologic
                     maps [Coward et al., 1988; Kidd et al., 1988; Qinghai Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources (QBGMR), 1989a,
                     1989b]. Here we include an updated geologic map for the central Hoh Xil Basin that includes new structural
                     observations from this work and updated stratigraphic ages from Staisch et al. [2014]. Resolution of the defor-
                     mation history of the northern Tibetan Plateau affords potential insight into the Eurasian lithospheric response
                     to continental collision and the geodynamic mechanisms involved in building extensive high topography.


                     2. Geologic Setting
                     The Hoh Xil Basin is located in the north central Tibetan Plateau, bounded to the south by the Tanggula Shan and
                     to the north by the Kunlun Shan. The basin spans roughly 83,000 km2 and has an average elevation of ~4800 m.
                     The Jinsha Suture trends east-west roughly near the center of the Hoh Xil Basin; thus, the basin extends across the
                     Qiangtang and Songpan-Ganzi terranes (Figure 1). The Fenghuoshan Range is located in the center of the Hoh Xil
                     Basin, near the town of Erdaguo (            ), and is roughly 35 km in north-south extent (Figure 3a).

                     2.1. Stratigraphy of the Hoh Xil Basin
                     Permian to Quaternary rocks are exposed throughout the Fenghuoshan Range and surrounding regions
                     [QBGMR, 1989a, 1989b]. The marine Permian Wuli Group (                   ; P2wl) is the oldest unit mapped in this
                     region and is composed of dark grey lithic sandstone, siltstone, and shale interbedded with bioclastic
                     limestone, carbonaceous shale, and coal [QBGMR, 1989b]. It is roughly 830 m thick [QBGMR, 1989b] and is exclu-
                     sively exposed south of the Fenghuoshan Range along the south directed Tuotuohe thrust (TT; Figure 3a). The
                     overlying Middle Triassic units, which are also only reported to the south of the Fenghuoshan Range, are divided
                     into clastic and carbonaceous units of a combined ~500 m thickness [QBGMR, 1989b]. The upper Triassic Jieza
                     Group (           ; Tr3jz) ranges in stratigraphic thickness from ~3660 m north of the Fenghuoshan Range to as
                     little as ~1700 m in the south and, in the southern FFTB, lies unconformably on the Middle Triassic units (Tr2a-b)
                     [QBGMR, 1989a, 1989b]. It is composed of grey-green ﬁne- to coarse-grained marine feldspathic sandstone
                     interbedded with dark grey to black carbonaceous shale, siltstone, and bioclastic limestone [QBGMR, 1989a,
                     1989b]. North of the Fenghuoshan Range, the Triassic Bayan Har Group (                          ; Tr3by) is deposited
                     conformably over the Jieza Group and is composed of grey to dark grey silty slate interbedded with ﬁne-grained
                     lithic feldspathic sandstone [QBGMR, 1989a]. The Bayan Har Group is not exposed within or south of the
                     Fenghuoshan Range. The Triassic sedimentary package exhibits a large variation in stratigraphic thickness from
                     south to north. While some degree of postdepositional erosion of Triassic strata is possible, the northward
                     increase in stratigraphic thickness is more likely the result of the Mesozoic tectonic setting of the Hoh Xil
                     Basin. During the Triassic, the Jinsha Suture was an active convergent margin between the Qiangtang terrane
                     to the south and the subducting Songpan-Ganzi terrane to the north [Yin and Nie, 1993; Zhou and Graham,
                     1996]. As a remnant oceanic basin, the Songpan-Ganzi terrane likely accumulated far more marine strata during
                     the Early Mesozoic, which accounts for the ﬁvefold increase in Triassic marine stratigraphic thickness in the
                     northern portion of the Hoh Xil Basin.
                     Terrestrial sedimentary rocks exposed within the Hoh Xil Basin range from Late Cretaceous to Miocene in age
                     [Yin et al., 1988; Zhong, 1989; Li and Yuan, 1990; Ji, 1994; Liu et al., 2001, 2003; An et al., 2004; Yi et al., 2004;
                     Li et al., 2012; Staisch et al., 2014] such that the basin records a nearly continuous depositional history over
                     this time period. The Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) to early Eocene (Ypresian) Fenghuoshan Group
                     (               ; K2fn-Pe1-2fn) is the ﬁrst record of terrestrial sedimentation and uplift above sea level in the
                     Hoh Xil Basin [Staisch et al., 2014]. In central Hoh Xil Basin, this unit is disconformably deposited on the
                     Bayan Har and Jieza Groups [QBGMR, 1989a, 1989b]. The Fenghuoshan Group is composed largely of ﬂuvial
                     to fan delta mudstone, siltstone, ﬁne to coarse sandstone, and conglomerate, with a minor component of
                     lacustrine carbonate [Leeder et al., 1988; QBGMR, 1989a, 1989b; Zhong, 1989; Ji, 1994; Liu et al., 2001; An
                     et al., 2004]. These sedimentary rocks are characteristically brick red to greyish purple in color, with occasional
                     light green, copper-bearing layers [Yin et al., 1988; Li et al., 2005]. Isopach maps suggest that the Fenghuoshan
                     Group was deposited in multiple subbasins (including the Fenghuoshan, Hantaishan, and Wudaoliang

                                Tectonics                                                                                           10.1002/2015TC003972



                                         subbasins) and that sedimentation was thickest within the lenticular-shaped Fenghuoshan subbasin, near
                                         the town of Erdaguo (Figure 3c) [Liu et al., 2001]. The Fenghuoshan subbasin depocenter migrated northward
                                         with progressive inﬁlling, such that the lowermost Fenghuoshan Group is thickest in the south and the mid-
                                         dle and upper units are thickest in the Central Fenghuoshan Range (Figure 3c) [Liu et al., 2001].
                                         Paleocurrent data [Leeder et al., 1988; Liu and Wang, 2001b; Liu et al., 2001; Yi et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008; Li
                                         et al., 2012] and U-Pb zircon provenance data [Dai et al., 2012] and analysis [Staisch et al., 2014] suggest that
                                         the Fenghuoshan Group strata were sourced from the south, likely the Tanggula Shan in the central
                                         Qiangtang terrane. This is consistent with thermochronologic data that indicate unrooﬁng of the Tanggula
                                         Shan at ~60–50 Ma [Wang et al., 2008] and the timing of magmatic intrusion within the range [Roger et al.,
                                         2000; Duan et al., 2005]. Basin development and deposition of the Fenghuoshan Group was likely caused
                                         by thrust loading and erosion of the Tanggula fold and thrust belt (TFTB) and suggests that the Tanggula
                                         Shan has been a local topographic high throughout much of the Cenozoic. Flat-lying volcanic rocks that over-
                                         lie strongly deformed strata in the TFTB have been dated at 44.6–40.2 Ma [Wang et al., 2008]. These dates,
                                         when combined with evidence for the onset of slow cooling of this region by ~45 Ma [Rohrmann et al.,
                                         2012], suggest that N-S contraction and rapid erosion of the TFTB ceased by the early Eocene. No evidence
                                         for syndepositional deformation of the Fenghuoshan Group has been recognized, suggesting that crustal
                                         shortening did not progress into the Hoh Xil Basin until after ~51 Ma.
                                         The Eocene to early Oligocene Tuotuohe Group (                  ; Pe2tt) unconformably overlies the Fenghuoshan
                                         Group and is exposed along the South Fenghuoshan thrust fault (SFT) and in the Tuotuohe subbasin, located to
                                         the south of the Fenghuoshan Range [QBGMR, 1989a; Staisch et al., 2014]. It is composed of beige to brick red
                                         medium sandstone and conglomerate [QBGMR, 1989a, 1989b; Staisch et al., 2014]. The inclusion of
                                         Fenghuoshan Group clasts within the Tuotuohe Group strata indicates that it was, at least in part, sourced from
                                         the Fenghuoshan Range [Staisch et al., 2014]. The Oligocene Yaxicuo Group (                 ; Pe2-3yx) is composed
                                         of beige to orange siltstone and sandstone with subordinate gypsum layers [Liu and Wang, 2001a; Liu et al.,
                                         2001, 2003; Li et al., 2012] and is found both north and south of the Fenghuoshan Range, where it is moderately
                                         deformed. Previous interpretations of regional stratigraphy in the Hoh Xil Basin inferred that the Yaxicuo Group
                                         overlay the Tuotuohe Group but, based on the overlap in biostratigraphically constrained depositional ages and
                                         ﬁeld relations between the two units, it may be more plausible that the upper Tuotuohe Group and lower
                                         Yaxicuo Group represent facies variations in an early Oligocene depositional system [Z. Duan et al., 2007;
                                         Q. Duan et al., 2007, 2008; Staisch et al., 2014].
                                         The Miocene Wudaoliang Group (                   ; N1wd) unconformably overlies many of the units in the region
                                         [QBGMR, 1989a, 1989b; Z. Duan et al., 2007]. It is composed primarily of lacustrine carbonate and ranges from
                                         a few meters to 200 m in thickness [QBGMR, 1989a, 1989b]. The Wudaoliang Group has only been mildly
                                         deformed in the northern Hoh Xil Basin, indicating that major north-south oriented contraction in the Hoh
                                         Xil Basin ceased by Miocene time [Liu and Wang, 2001b; Liu et al., 2001, 2003; Li et al., 2012].
                                         Igneous rocks are relatively sparse within the Fenghuoshan Range and limited to small volume late Oligocene
                                         syenitic intrusions [QBGMR, 1989a, 1989b; Duan et al., 2005] and late Oligocene subhorizontal basalt ﬂows that
                                         are preserved in the Fenghuoshan Range and cap deformed Fenghuoshan Group strata [Staisch et al., 2014].

                                         2.2. Structural Geology of the Fenghuoshan Fold and Thrust Belt
                                         East-west trending folds and east-west striking thrust faults are exposed within the Fenghuoshan fold and thrust
                                         belt and postdate deposition of the Fenghuoshan Group [Liu et al., 2001, 2003; Wang et al., 2008; Staisch et al.,
                                         2014]. The majority of thrust faults and folds are located within the Fenghuoshan Range, while faults and folds
                                         to the north and south of the Fenghuoshan Range are fewer and less well exposed. Within the Fenghuoshan
                                         Range proper, the wavelength of structures is typically 4–8 km (Figure 3a) and folds are typically open to

                                        moderately tight with inclined axial planes. At the southernmost extent of the Fenghuoshan Range, west of the
                                        Lhasa-Golmud Highway, tight to isoclinal folds are northwest vergent and have a wavelength of 2–4 km (
                                        Figure 3a). Faulting and folding to the north and south of the Fenghuoshan Range are present but at a greater
                                        wavelength of ~18 km in between structures. Three major thrust faults and two back thrusts deﬁne the
                                        Fenghuoshan fold and thrust belt (Figure 3a). Here we name the thrust faults, from north to south, the Central

                                                                ), and the Tuotuohe thrust fault (TT;                       ). We name the two major back
                                        thrusts, from north to south, the North Fenghuoshan back thrust (NFBT;                                       ) and the
                                        Erdaguo back thrust (EBT;                        ). Slickenlines and chatter marks from a small back thrust subor-
                                        dinate to the Erdaguo back thrust indicate that the primary sense of motion is roughly north-south (Figure 4b).
                                        Previous structural mapping in the region guided new mapping efforts in this study [Kidd et al., 1988; QBGMR,
                                        1989a, 1989b], and we reﬁne the geometries of, and reinterpret the description of, several previously mapped
                                        geologic structures. Speciﬁcally, bedding orientations were consistently tilted with no apparent displacement
                                        across a fault originally mapped ~3 km north of the SFT and another mapped ~5 km south of the NFBT [Kidd
                                        et al., 1988]. Our ﬁeld investigation found that strata across a fault originally mapped ~6 km north of the EBT

                     [Kidd et al., 1988] were moderately to tightly folded along the Lhasa-Golmud Highway, but not faulted
                     (Figure 3a). Satellite imagery, however, clearly shows south directed fault offset in upper Fenghuoshan
                     Group strata along a northwestern portion of the mapped fault (Figure 3a). We therefore suggest that the
                     fault mapped ~6 km north of the EBT does not extend into the lower Fenghuoshan Group strata and that
                     it does not accommodate major shortening.
                     Along the southern margin of the Fenghuoshan Range, the South directed South Fenghuoshan thrust fault
                     places lower Fenghuoshan Group and unconformably overlying Tuotuohe Group strata over the Yaxicuo
                     Group (Figure 4a), indicating that deformation within the Hoh Xil Basin occurred during and after deposition
                     of the Tuotuohe and Yaxicuo Groups [Staisch et al., 2014]. Syndepositional deformation likely explains the tilting
                     of Tuotuohe and Yaxicuo strata in thrust fault footwalls. Roughly 20 km to the south of the Fenghuoshan Range,
                     deformation of a 33.5 Ma rhyodacite indicates that crustal shortening continued after this time (Figure 3a) [Staisch
                     et al., 2014]. Subhorizontal late Oligocene basalt ﬂows and only mild tilting of Miocene Wudaoliang lacustrine
                     strata indicate that crustal shortening within the Hoh Xil Basin was largely complete by ~27 Ma. Together, these
                     constraints suggest that north-south shortening of the Hoh Xil Basin took place between the early Eocene and
                     late Oligocene. However, the ~51–27 Ma duration of deformation is constrained by geologic events that predate
                     and postdate the timing of deformation, thus representing a maximum duration of deformation. Furthermore,
                     these ages provide limited information about the magnitude of upper crustal deformation and potential crustal
                     thickening in the Hoh Xil Basin. In this work, we directly assess the timing and magnitude of deformation and
                     interpret our results in regard to the geodynamic mechanisms of surface uplift of the northern Tibetan Plateau.

                     3. Timing of Deformation in the Fenghuoshan Fold and Thrust Belt
                     In order to address the timing of deformation within the Fenghuoshan fold and thrust belt, we employ
                     40
                       Ar/39Ar fault gouge dating and low-temperature thermochronology. Fault gouge dating directly dates clay
                     minerals formed during faulting, whereas low-temperature thermochronologic ages provide information on
                     the onset, duration, and rate of exhumation of rocks toward the Earth’s surface, which can be related to
                     deformation. With these two techniques, we provide new constraints on the deformation history of the
                     Fenghuoshan fold and thrust belt.

                     3.1.        Ar/39Ar Fault Gouge Dating
                     Fault gouge dating is a method of radiometrically determining the age of fault-grown clay minerals that has
                     been applied in a variety of geographic locales and tectonic settings [van der Pluijm et al., 2001, 2006; Solum
                     et al., 2005; Solum and van der Pluijm, 2007; Haines and van der Pluijm, 2008, 2010; Duvall et al., 2011]. Previous
                     studies typically interpret the 40Ar/39Ar fault gouge age to represent the timing of most recent fault slip [van
                     der Pluijm et al., 2001, 2006; Solum et al., 2005; Solum and van der Pluijm, 2007; Haines and van der Pluijm, 2008,
                     2010]. Alternatively, recent work that combines fault gouge dating and thermochronologic data suggests
                     that fault gouge ages represent the time at which authigenic illite was grown at depth [Duvall et al., 2011].
                     This latter interpretation implies that either continued faulting or erosion exhumes the fault-generated authi-
                     genic illite to the surface and that the fault gouge age may not represent the time of most recent faulting but
                     rather only partially record the time during which faulting was active [Duvall et al., 2011].
                     Clay-rich fault gouge often contains two distinct potassium-bearing illite polytypes that are assumed to be
                     either detrital (the 2 M1 polytype) or authigenically grown within the fault zone (the 1Md polytype) [Pevear,
                     1999]. Separation of pure authigenic illite to date the timing of fault gouge formation is rarely feasible due
                     to the size of clay particles, and so fault gouge dating relies on a linear extrapolation to the pure authigenic
                     illite age from a two end-member mixing model of 40Ar/39Ar ages derived from aliquots that contain both
                     2 M1 and 1Md illite polytypes [Pevear, 1999; van der Pluijm et al., 2001, 2006; Solum and van der Pluijm,
                     2007; Haines and van der Pluijm, 2008, 2010; Duvall et al., 2011].
                     3.1.1. Sample Collection and Preparation
                     We collected and analyzed two fault gouge samples from the Fenghuoshan Range. The ﬁrst sample was
                     collected from the south-southwest directed Central Fenghuoshan thrust fault (CFT), which is internal to
                     the Fenghuoshan Range (Figures 3a and 5a). The second sample was collected along the north dipping,
                     south directed range bounding South Fenghuoshan thrust fault (SFT) (Figures 3a and 5b). The fault gouge
                     samples were separated into multiple size fractions by gravitational separation in a centrifuge, which
                     separates the clay particles via Stokes’ law. Since detrital (2 M1) illite clay particles are typically larger than

                                         the silica tube is broken under vacuum in a VG1200S mass spectrometer. The recoiled fraction of Ar is measured

                     (10UMT09; Figure 5b), XRD powder pattern analysis suggests that clay size fractions contain 75%, 55%, 39%,
                     and 15% (±4%) detrital illite, respectively (Table 1 and Figure S2). Total gas ages for these size fractions are
                     127.60 ± 2.40, 96.91 ± 0.80, 84.69 ± 1.12, and 64.65 ± 2.06 Ma, respectively (Tables 1 and S1 and Figure 6).
                     3.1.3. Bayesian Linear Regression and Fault Gouge Age Interpretation
                     To estimate the authigenic and detrital illite end-member ages, we perform a linear regression through measured
                     size fraction ages and polytype concentrations (Figure 7) [van der Pluijm et al., 2001, 2006]. A challenge in estimat-
                     ing end-member ages of detrital and authigenic illite is propagating uncertainties of both the estimated propor-
                     tion of 2 M1 to 1Md polytype in each size fraction and the measured 40Ar/39Ar ages into uncertainties in the slope
                     and intercept of the regression line. Previous solutions to this problem have used a York regression [York, 1968;
                     van der Pluijm et al., 2001, 2006; Solum et al., 2005; Solum and van der Pluijm, 2007; Haines and van der Pluijm, 2008,
                     2010; Duvall et al., 2011]. We have modiﬁed this method by implementing a Bayesian approach to the linear
                     regression (Appendix A). Both approaches resolve similar best ﬁt illite end-member ages. The Bayesian approach
                     also delineates 95% credible intervals on the slope and intercept values of the regression, and accepted regres-
                     sion models illustrate the covariance between these values (Figure S3). The Bayesian approach is also capable of
                     resolving uncertainties in slope and intercept values when correlation coefﬁcients between X and Y errors are
                     unknown or unspeciﬁed, which is advantageous in some situations as compared to the York formulation.
                     In our regressions, we assume an 40Ar/39Ar age uncertainty of 3% of the measured age in order to account for
                     external errors such as sample quality, inhomogeneity in standards, and variations in interlaboratory and

                     by the age of the Fenghuoshan Group source material, which is the lithologically heterogeneous Tanggula Shan
                     [Pan et al., 2004; Li et al., 2011; Staisch et al., 2014]. We therefore attribute the difference in 2 M1 illite ages to a
                     variable detrital illite source in the Fenghuoshan Group strata.

                     3.2.1. Sample Collection and Processing
                     Low-temperature thermochronology measures the timing and rate of exhumation in the upper several kilo-
                     meters of the crust and is commonly utilized to resolve the timing of deformation [Warnock et al., 1997;
                     Farley, 2000; Ehlers and Farley, 2003; Braun, 2005; Tagami and O’Sullivan, 2005]. To constrain the exhumation

                     history of the Fenghuoshan Range, we collected nine samples from various thrust sheets; however, only two
                     medium coarse-grained sandstone samples yielded high-quality minerals for apatite (U-Th)/He and apatite ﬁs-
                     sion track analysis. The southernmost sample, 11UMT16, was collected from the hanging wall of the SFT, near
                     the fault trace. A second sample, 11UMT22, was collected near the core of an anticline in the northern portion of
                     the Fenghuoshan Range, in the hanging wall of the NFBT and the footwall of the EBT (Figure 3a).
                     Apatite crystals were separated using standard magnetic and density separation techniques and handpicked for
                     (U-Th)/He analysis to ensure crystal quality [Ehlers and Farley, 2003]. For (U-Th)/He dating, apatite aliquots were
                     outgassed using an AlphaChron Instrument at the University of Michigan He Laboratory and U, Th, Sm, and Ca
                     concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) at the University
                     of Arizona LaserChron Center following standard procedures [Farley and Stockli, 2002]. For apatite ﬁssion track
                     dating, samples were analyzed at Apatite to Zircon, Inc. [Donelick et al., 2005]. Apatite ﬁssion track densities were
                     counted from grain mounts that were polished and etched to reveal natural ﬁssion tracks. Elemental concentra-
                     tions of 238U, 232Th, and 147Sm were measured via laser ablation inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry
                     (LA-ICP-MS). Grain mounts were then irradiated under a 252Cf source and etched for ﬁssion track length measure-
                     ment. Apatite ﬁssion track ages were estimated from a decay equation modiﬁed to include calibration for LA-ICP-
                     MS results using the Durango ﬂuorapatite standard [Donelick et al., 2005].
                     3.2.2. Apatite (U-Th)/He Results
                     Apatite (U-Th)/He ages for the north sample (11UMT22) range between 26.7 and 29.3 Ma, with the exception
                     of a single grain that was dated at 10.1 Ma (Table S2). This grain was considered an outlier based on Dixon’s Q
                     test and removed from further analysis [Dean and Dixon, 1951]. The mean age and 2σ standard error of the
                     remaining single-grain analyses for this sample is 28.2 ± 1.5 Ma (Table 2). The southern sample (11UMT16)
                     apatite (U-Th)/He ages range between 23.1 and 30.6 Ma (Table S2) with a mean and 2σ standard error of
                     25.8 ± 4.0 Ma (Table 2).
                     3.2.3. Apatite Fission Track Results
                     For each sample, 40 apatite grains were analyzed for ﬁssion track thermochronology. Fission track length
                     distributions were determined from 175 and 48 track length measurements for samples 11UMT16 and
                     11UMT22, respectively. The apatite ﬁssion track (AFT) ages measured in samples 11UMT22 and 11UMT16
                     (Tables S3–S6) do not pass the standard χ 2 criterion [Galbraith, 1981; Green, 1981], suggesting that single-grain
                     AFT ages are not derived from the same population. Along with the variation in measured kinetic parameters
                     (Dpar and rmr0), this indicates that our samples are composed of multiple kinetic populations with a range of
                     annealing behaviors and closure temperatures, which is common for sedimentary rocks sourced from large
                     areas with variable apatite chemistry [Ketcham et al., 1999, 2007]. The identiﬁcation of multiple kinetic popula-
                     tions allows for more robust ﬁssion track age interpretation and improved inverse modeling of ﬁssion track data.
                     We identiﬁed two kinetic populations in each sample using HeFTy (version 1.7.5), a program for thermochro-
                     nologic data analysis and modeling [Ketcham, 2005]. Kinetic populations were deﬁned by the parameter rmr0,
                     where apatite crystals with a high rmr0 value are typically less resistant to annealing and are therefore likely to
                     have a lower closure temperature than apatite grains with low rmr0 values [Ketcham et al., 1999]. For sample
                     11UMT16, the two kinetic populations have pooled ages of 41.9 ± 9.7 and 31.0 ± 9.8 Ma, mean ﬁssion track
                     lengths of 14.24 ± 1.18 and 14.17 ± 1.28 μm, and rmr0 values of 0.53 and 0.80, respectively (Tables 2 and S3
                     and Figure S5). The two kinetic populations in sample 11UMT22 have pooled ages of 30.4 ± 11.4 and 29.2
                     ± 9.3 Ma, mean track lengths of 14.42 ± 0.98 and 14.1 ± 0.92 μm, and rmr0 values of 0.84 and 0.79, respectively
                     (Tables 2 and S4 and Figure S5).
                     3.2.4. HeFTy Inverse Modeling of Apatite Helium and Fission Track Data
                     Single-grain apatite (U-Th)/He ages for each sample, along with apatite ﬁssion track age and length data for
                     multiple kinetic populations, were used to constrain HeFTy models of time-temperature histories [Ketcham,
                     2005]. We used the radiation damage accumulation and annealing model (RDAAM) helium diffusion model
                     for apatite (U-Th)/He data [Flowers et al., 2009] and the Ketcham et al. [2007] model for ﬁssion track annealing
                     behavior. Three geologic constraints from Staisch et al. [2014] were placed on each model run: (1) samples
                     collected from the lower Fenghuoshan Group were at the surface, and thus between 0 and 20°C, within
                     the interval of 85–60 Ma based on the depositional age of the Fenghuoshan Group; (2) samples were buried
                     to depth and at temperatures that exceed 40°C within the interval of 75–35 Ma; and (3) based on the absolute
                     age and age uncertainty of unconformably overlying late Oligocene volcanic rocks, the southern sample
                     (11UMT16) was at the surface (0–20°C), between 30 and 25 Ma. We tested HeFTy model runs for the southern

                 Tectonics                                                                             10.1002/2015TC003972



                     thermochronologic sample that both included and excluded the third geologic constraint. For all HeFTy mod-
                     els, we also employed the constraint that each sample was fully reset at some time prior to sedimentary
                     deposition (120–200°C from 150 to 130 Ma). We found that the Cenozoic exhumation histories were not sen-
                     sitive to any earlier resetting history, and we exclude those earlier histories from further discussion.
                     Goodness of ﬁt is determined by comparing modeled apatite ﬁssion track and (U-Th)/He ages for each thermal
                     history to measured data for each grain. Kuiper’s statistic was used to deﬁne the goodness of ﬁt of modeled and
                     measured track length distributions for each kinetic population [Kuiper, 1960]. To constrain “good” and “accep-
                     table” model ﬁts, we chose typical values of 0.5 and 0.05, respectively [Ketcham, 2005]. We ran each model until
                     at least 10,000 time-temperature paths were generated and at least 100 good ﬁt model paths were obtained.
                     3.2.5. Modeling Results
                     The model results for samples 11UMT16 and 11UMT22 give a consistent thermal history of burial to maximum
                     temperatures followed by cooling over a deﬁned interval, which we relate to fault motion (Figure 8). For both
                     samples, the good ﬁt models show a narrow range of Cenozoic time-temperature paths. We evaluate the good
                     ﬁt time-temperature histories using PDFs from which we extract ages and rates of purported events in terms of
                     the modal parameter value and 1σ variability. These events include the following: timing of initial cooling, time
                     at which samples reached near-surface temperatures, cooling rate, and maximum burial temperature.
                     The time-temperature histories resolved for the northernmost sample (11UMT22; Figure 8a) suggest that this
                     sample was buried to a maximum temperature of 154.7 ± 21.9°C by 38.6 ± 7.8 Ma. The sample was then
                     cooled at a rate of ~5.8°C Ma1 until 26.6 ± 4.5 Ma, after which it remained at near-surface temperatures
                     (Figure 8a). The cooling rate over this interval of relatively rapid exhumation translates to an apparent erosion
                     rate of ~0.2 mm yr1, assuming a geothermal gradient of 25–30°C km1.
                     The time-temperature histories modeled for the southernmost sample (11UMT16) that include the basalt
                     constraint (Figure 8b) indicate that this sample was buried to a maximum temperature of 173.6 ± 21.3°C by
                     39.3 ± 8.0 Ma. Exhumation of this sample continued until 25.4 ± 0.5 Ma, during which time the average
                     cooling rate is modeled at ~8.6°C Ma1. After this time, the sample remained at surface temperatures
                     (Figure 8b). This cooling rate translates to an apparent erosion rate of 0.3–0.4 mm yr1, assuming a geother-
                     mal gradient of 25–30°C km1.
                     The good ﬁt time-temperature histories modeled for the southernmost sample collected from the
                     Fenghuoshan Range (11UMT16) that do not include the basalt constraint (Figure 8c) indicate that the sample
                     was buried to 178.5 ± 23.2°C by 39.7 ± 8.4 Ma, followed by exhumation that continued until ~21.2 ± 3.4 Ma
                     during which the sample cooled at a rate of ~5.0°C Ma1. This cooling rate translates of an apparent erosion
                     rate of ~0.2 mm yr1. For sample 11UMT16, both models (with and without the late Oligocene basalt
                     constraint) require cooling onset to occur at 39.3 or 39.7 Ma, respectively, and differ slightly in the projected
                     arrival to near-surface temperatures at 25.4 or 21.2 Ma, respectively. The effect of using the basalt as a
                     constraint forces cooling histories that arrive at the surface a few million years earlier and therefore have
                     higher apparent exhumation rates. Given that the projected surface arrival ages are different by only a few
                     million years, we consider that the data are compatible with the geologic constraint provided by ﬂay-lying
                     Oligocene basalt ﬂows [Staisch et al., 2014], even when that constraint is not imposed on the model.
                     Because of the importance and clear geologic context of the undeformed ~27 Ma basalt, we give preference
                     to the thermal modeling results of 11UMT16 that is inclusive of this constraint.
                     The HeFTy modeled cooling histories for both samples (11UMT16 and 11UMT22) suggest that rapid exhuma-
                     tion of the Fenghuoshan fold and thrust belt initiated by ~39 Ma, subsequent to the ~51 Ma cessation of
                     Fenghuoshan Group deposition [Staisch et al., 2014]. The initiation of rapid cooling overlaps within uncer-
                     tainty with the timing of fault motion along the SFT and CFT, indicating that exhumation is fault related.
                     Thermochronologic models suggest that exhumation continued until ~31–25 Ma and is generally consistent
                     with geochronologic data from Staisch et al. [2014], which indicates that deformation lasted at least until
                     ~34 Ma and ceased by ~27 Ma.

                     independently constrain the initiation of crustal shortening in Hoh Xil Basin soon after the 60–50 Ma onset of
                     the Indo-Asian collision. The timing of deformation we infer from fault gouge and thermochronologic ana-
                     lyses differs from previous interpretations for the timing of shortening in the Hoh Xil Basin [Wang et al.,
                     2008], in which deformation is suggested to be primarily late Oligocene in age (~30–22 Ma). This interpretation
                     was based on the observation, with which we concur, that deformation is younger than the depositional age of
                     the Fenghuoshan Group. Previous estimates placed the deposition of the Fenghuoshan Group from 52 to
                     31 Ma [Liu et al., 2001, 2003]. Recently, however, the depositional history of the Hoh Xil Basin has been revised

                     based on absolute age control and reﬁnes the depositional age of the Fenghuoshan Group to be Late
                     Cretaceous to earliest Eocene [Staisch et al., 2014]. In this context, the apatite ﬁssion track ages reported by
                     Wang et al. [2008], which range between 47 and 36 Ma (Table 2), are younger than the depositional age of
                     the Fenghuoshan Group and therefore record tectonic exhumation in Eocene time, consistent with our thermo-
                     chronologic and fault gouge data.
                     3.3.2. Cessation
                     The youngest absolute age control on crustal shortening in the Hoh Xil Basin is a deformed rhyodacitic ﬂow
                     dated at 33.5 Ma [Staisch et al., 2014]. This, along with 27.3 Ma ﬂat-lying basalts [Staisch et al., 2014] and wide-
                     spread, ﬂat-lying Miocene (24–14 Ma) carbonates in the northern Tibetan Plateau [Wu et al., 2008], provides
                     strong evidence for the cessation of upper crustal shortening within the Hoh Xil Basin to be between 33.5 and
                     27.3 Ma (Figure 10). The thermal histories of the north and south FFTB constrained by modeling of apatite ﬁs-
                     sion track and (U-Th)/He data presented above suggest that rapid cooling ceased by 31–25 Ma and are gen-
                     erally consistent with evidence for the cessation of deformation by 27.3 Ma [Staisch et al., 2014].


                     4. Balanced Cross Section of the Fenghuoshan Fold and Thrust Belt
                     We present a balanced cross section that was constructed within the Fenghuoshan fold and thrust belt to
                     determine the magnitude of Cenozoic shortening. While several cross sections constructed in the region
                     have been previously published [Coward et al., 1988; Wang et al., 2002], these lines of section did not incor-
                     porate variations in stratigraphic unit thicknesses, which is a potentially large source of uncertainty in esti-
                     mates of crustal shortening [Judge and Allmendinger, 2011]. In this work, we incorporate variations in unit

                     [Judge and Allmendinger, 2011]. Furthermore, we incorporate fault gouge dating and low-temperature ther-
                     mochronologic constraints, described above, to include the timing and progression of deformation into a
                     kinematic reconstruction of crustal shortening within the Hoh Xil Basin.

                     4.1. Data Collection and Field Observations
                     The cross section was constructed along a N17°E transect and spans the north-south extent of the fold and thrust
                     belt (Figure 3a; A-A′). The cross section has a present-day length of ~107 km, strikes parallel to the inferred direc-
                     tion of maximum convergence, and was chosen to maximize inclusion of available structural measurements and
                     observations and to exploit the intersection of surface geology and topography. A break in section was
                     required to meet the aforementioned criteria and was placed along a stratigraphic contact along a major syncl-
                     inal limb (Figure 3a). The structural interpretations presented in our cross section are guided by new geologic
                     mapping and measured bedding orientations in the area (Figure 3a and Table S7) and supplemented by exist-
                     ing geologic mapping [Kidd et al., 1988; QBGMR, 1989a, 1989b]. Fold axial plane geometries were estimated
                     from structural measurements within fold limbs and used to guide construction of the cross section (Figure 9
                     a). Direct measurements of fault plane orientations were not possible due to the lack of fault plane exposure,
                     aside from a single small back thrust (Figure 4b). However, fault geometry strongly inﬂuences the geometric
                     relationships in the overlying folded strata [Suppe, 1985; Rowan and Linares, 2000; Allmendinger and Shaw,
                     2000; Wilkerson et al., 2002], and so we were able to estimate fault geometry at depth from measurements of
                     hanging wall folds. Our structural interpretations of fault geometries at depth are described in Appendix B.
                     The stratigraphic thickness of the Fenghuoshan Group is based on isopach data from Liu et al. [2001] (Figure 3
                     c). The thicknesses of the overlying Tuotuohe and Yaxicuo Groups and the underlying Wuli, Jieza, and Bayan
                     Har Groups are based on existing geologic maps and associated stratigraphic columns [QBGMR, 1989a,
                     1989b]. While stratigraphic and isopach thickness estimates may be inﬂuenced by postdepositional erosion
                     or burial, we consider these published estimates to be the best available data for lateral variations in strati-
                     graphic thickness. The north-south variations in stratigraphic thickness of the Fenghuoshan Group are con-
                     sistent with Cretaceous to Eocene thrust loading within the Hoh Xil Basin due to shortening and
                     thickening within the Tanggula Shan. The underlying Triassic and Permian strata vary signiﬁcantly in strati-
                     graphic thickness along the cross section; such variations arise from a combination of lateral variation in sedi-
                     ment accumulation and subsequent erosion. The location of the Jinsha Suture and the Mesozoic tectonic
                     history of the Qiangtang and Songpan-Ganzi terranes likely exert a strong inﬂuence on the north-south

                                           lateral variations in Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic sedimentary thicknesses [Yin and Nie, 1993; Zhou and
                                           Graham, 1996]. An observed depositional contact between the lower Fenghuoshan Group and the Triassic
                                           Jieza Group at the southern limit of the cross section, and the presence of the intervening Triassic Bayan
                                           Har Group to the north, indicates that the variations in along-strike sedimentary thickness of pre-
                                           Cretaceous strata were established before deposition of the Fenghuoshan Group.
                                           4.2. Methods and Error Propagation
                                           The cross section along transect A-A′ (Figures 3a and 9a) was constructed based on new and published bed-
                                           ding orientation measurements [Kidd et al., 1988] (Figure 3a and Table S7) and ﬁeld observations. The vast
                                           majority of bedding orientation measurements were taken from the Fenghuoshan Group, with few from
                                           the younger Tuotuohe and Yaxicuo strata due to the poor quality of exposure of the Tuotuohe and
                                           Yaxicuo Group strata. The depositional age and structural relationships of the Tuotuohe and Yaxicuo
                                           Groups suggest that these strata were syntectonically deposited [Staisch et al., 2014]. Thus, while we show
                                           bedding orientations taken from syntectonic to posttectonic units on the cross section, our shortening esti-
                                           mate does not include structural data from these strata. The mapped surface geology, including stratigraphic
                                           contacts from Fenghuoshan Group and older strata, fault and fold traces, and bedding orientation measure-
                                           ments were located precisely on our line of section (Figures 3a and 9a). The mapped contacts of younger
                                           strata are not depicted on the cross section, as these units were deposited during and after deformation
                                           and in many locations overlie and obscure older geologic contacts.
                                           We use both line and area balancing techniques for cross-section construction and retrodeformation. For line
                                           balancing, we use the sinuous bed method [Dahlstrom, 1969], in which bedding thickness is maintained while
                                           the length of the top and bottom of each unit and the lengths of fault ramps and ﬂats are matched in the
                                           deformed and undeformed cross sections. For area balancing, we match the area encompassed by deformed
                                           and sequentially retrodeformed units using the AreaErrorProp program presented in Judge and Allmendinger
                                           [2011]. To calculate the retrodeformed width, amount of shortening, and to propagate errors in our shortening
                                           estimate, we slightly modiﬁed equations presented in Judge and Allmendinger [2011]. These modiﬁcations were
                                           necessary to account for the more complicated décollement geometry in the FFTB (Appendix B). The para-
                                           meters used for area balancing and the propagation of uncertainty are shown in Table 3 and the calculated
                                           values of shortening and associated errors are shown in Table 4. The magnitude of slip along individual
                                           structures was estimated from the mapped fault trace geometries (Figure 3a), and the balanced cross section
                                           (Figure 9a), since hanging wall erosion and the relatively homogeneous stratigraphy of the Fenghuoshan
                                           Group did not allow for identiﬁcation of reliable hanging wall cutoffs in the ﬁeld.
                                           4.3. Results
                                           Retrodeformation of the Fenghuoshan fold and thrust belt cross section A-A′ (Figures 3a and 9a–9c) results in an
                                           original width of 141 ± 12 km and suggests that the FFTB was shortened by 34 ± 12 km (24 ± 9%). When com-
                                           pared to previous estimates of shortening within the Fenghuoshan fold and thrust belt, our shortening estimate
                                           is slightly less than the 50 km suggested by Coward et al. [1988] and similar, within error, to the 43 km estimate
                                           from Wang et al. [2002]. The deeper crustal structure inferred in our cross section represents the simplest admis-
                                           sible solution because we lack geophysical constraints on subsurface fault and bedding geometries. While com-
                                           plicated crustal structures may exist at depth (e.g., more duplexing or multiple detachment horizons), these are
                                           not reﬂected in the upper crustal shortening record of the Hoh Xil Basin and cannot accommodate a greater or
                                           lesser amount of shortening than observed at the surface [e.g., Volkmer et al., 2014].
                                           The reconstructed cross section A-A′ reveals that several structures are responsible for the majority of
                                           the observed shortening (Figures 3a and 9a). From north to south, these structures are the Central

shortening) to fully deformed (24% shortening). The timing for deformation in panels 1–6 is described in the text (section 4.4). From the construction of a palinspastically
restored cross section, we infer that deformation initiates in the northern FFTB (panel 1) and propagates southward in time (panel 5) until the frontal ramp of the
thrust wedge thinned and became subcritical, after which point the back thrust faults were activated to accommodate internal deformation and obtain critical taper.
A full-sized, single-page version of this cross section and restored section is available as Figure S8.

                                          Fenghuoshan thrust fault, the South Fenghuoshan thrust fault, and the Tuotuohe thrust fault. From our cross
                                          section, we ﬁnd that the Central Fenghuoshan thrust fault accommodates ~13.0 km of dip-slip displacement,
                                          placing the lowermost Fenghuoshan Group strata (K2fna) over younger Fenghuoshan Group strata (K2fnb-c).
                                          Along the southern margin of the Fenghuoshan Range, the South Fenghuoshan thrust fault places lowermost
                                          Fenghuoshan Group strata (K2fna) over the Tuotuohe and Yaxicuo Groups and accommodates ~6.6 km of dip-
                                          slip displacement (Figures 3a and 4a). The hanging wall of the Tuotuohe thrust fault exhumes the southern-
                                          most mapped exposure of the Fenghuoshan Group and accommodates ~4.5 km of dip-slip displacement.
                                          Several back thrusts accommodate small to moderate amounts of displacement within the Fenghuoshan fold
                                          and thrust belt (Figures 3a and 9a). The Erdaguo back thrust, which cuts across much of the Fenghuoshan
                                          Range, crosscuts the Central Fenghuoshan Thrust near the town of Erdaguo (Figure 3a) and accommodates
                                          ~0.7 km of dip-slip displacement. To the east and west of the Lhasa-Golmud Highway, the Erdaguo back
                                          thrust may reactivate portions of the Central Fenghuoshan thrust fault. To the north, the Fenghuoshan
                                          Range is bounded by the North Fenghuoshan back thrust, which accommodates ~3.5 km of dip-slip displa-
                                          cement. The crosscutting relationships between north and south directed faulting suggest that the back
                                          thrusts were active more recently than the south directed thrust faults. From this we infer that as deformation
                                          progressed to the south, the deforming thrust wedge above the basal décollement thinned and became
                                          subcritical, such that the frontal ramp could no longer propagate southward [Dahlen, 1990]. Subsequently,
                                          north-south contraction continued and the FFTB shortened internally in attempt to obtain critical taper, at
                                          which point underthrusting beneath the South Fenghuoshan and Central Fenghuoshan thrust faults caused
                                          back thrusting along the Erdaguo and North Fenghuoshan back thrusts [e.g., Gutscher and Kukowski, 1998].
                                          Within the central portion of the cross section, the spacing between fold axes is less than to the north or south
                                          and we observe exposures of the lower Fenghuoshan Group, possibly due to duplexing and increased displace-
                                          ment along south directed thrust faults (Figures 3a and 9a). If we estimate the amount of shortening over the
                                          central, highly deformed, portion of the FFTB, we ﬁnd ~38% shortening, much higher than the value obtained
                                          from the full cross section. These observations illustrate how the percentage of shortening in the Hoh Xil Basin
                                          may be overestimated if structural measurements are concentrated in the most highly deformed and well-
                                          exposed ranges in the region, where tectonic exhumation and fault displacement are greatest.
                                          This underscores the importance of expanding cross sections over larger regions in order to obtain more
                                          integrated shortening estimates. As a result, our estimate of the total amount of shortening measured
                                          across the FFTB (34 ± 12 km) is similar to previously published estimates (43–50 km) but the extended
                                          length of our cross section results in a disproportionately lower percentage of shortening (~24%) com-
                                          pared to previous studies that focused within the Fenghuoshan Range exclusively (40–43%) [Coward
                                          et al., 1988; Wang et al., 2002]. Our observations from the FFTB suggest that locations of well-exposed
                                          shortening in the northern Tibetan Plateau may correlate to regions of localized high-magnitude deforma-
                                          tion and that large magnitudes of additional shortening are not likely to be obscured beneath younger
                                          sedimentary cover.
                                          To the west of cross section A-A′, the folding pattern in the SFT hanging wall changes abruptly from mod-

                                          lized change in fold vergence can be explained by a lateral or oblique ramp on the SFT, in which slip
                                          along the fault is uniform [Wilkerson et al., 2002]. Isopach data show that the overall Fenghuoshan

                                                                                   presented in Wilkerson et al. [2002], bed-

                     the SFT estimated by our cross section (Figure 9a). We estimate that the westward increase in slip along
                     the SFT may amount to ~6–9 km. This would increase our shortening estimate by 4.3–6.5%, which is
                     within uncertainty of our estimated total shortening of the FFTB. Accordingly, we conclude that our
                     shortening estimate from section A-A′ is robust, regardless of whether the unique folding observed in
                     the SFT hanging wall is the expression of a slip gradient or a change in the SFT geometry at depth.

                     4.4. Timing and Spatial Distribution of Deformation
                     We present a series of sequentially retrodeformed cross sections (Figure 9c) to illustrate how the FFTB
                     may have deformed over time. The relative timing of fold and fault motion of the Fenghuoshan Range
                     is based in part on the depositional history of the Fenghuoshan Group [Staisch et al., 2014], on our
                     40
                        Ar/39Ar fault gouge ages from the Central Fenghuoshan and South Fenghuoshan thrust faults, and
                     on thermal modeling of apatite ﬁssion track and (U-Th)/He data. Additionally, a deformed 33.5 Ma rhyo-
                     dacitic lava ﬂow to the south of the Fenghuoshan Range [Staisch et al., 2014] was used to constrain the
                     timing of deformation along the Tuotuohe Fault. While not directly on our line of section, this lava ﬂow
                     was deformed during formation of a syncline in the hanging wall of the Tuotuohe Fault and thus bears
                     on the timing of motion along this structure. We emphasize that the sequential restoration provides
                     the relative timing of motion along FFTB structures and that absolute age constraints provide further
                     reﬁnement.
                     The timing of Fenghuoshan Group deposition and the lack of any syntectonic features preserved within the
                     Fenghuoshan Group strata indicate that deformation did not initiate within the Hoh Xil Basin before 51 Ma
                     (Figure 9c, panel 1) [Staisch et al., 2014]. Folding in the northern FFTB could have initiated as early as 51 Ma
                     (Figure 9c, panel 2) and, based on the 48–44 Ma fault gouge ages from the south and Central Fenghuoshan
                     thrust faults (Figure 7), certainly was ongoing in the central FFTB in the early to middle Eocene (Figure 9c,
                     panels 3 and 4). Thermochronologic data from the hanging wall of the SFT suggest that this structure
                     continued to accommodate shortening into the late Oligocene (Figure 9c, panels 4). Fault gouge and
                     thermochronologic data do not indicate precisely when deformation propagated southward to the
                                                                                      Tuotuohe thrust fault; however, the deformed

                     that the crust was between 20 and 41 km thick prior to Eocene to

                     crust thickens independently of the upper crust and mantle lithosphere [Clark et al., 2005; Karplus et al., 2011;
                     Jiang et al., 2014; Le Pape et al., 2015], preferential thickening of the lower crust and mantle lithosphere beneath
                     a midcrustal detachment [Isacks, 1988; Gubbels et al., 1993], and mantle root loss [Molnar et al., 1993]. In the fol-
                     lowing section, we compare the available estimates of Cenozoic surface elevation in the northern Tibetan Plateau
                     and various proposed mechanisms of surface uplift based on the timing and magnitude of shortening in the Hoh
                     Xil Basin and isostatic balance.

                     5.1. Shortening-Related Crustal Thickening and Surface Uplift
                     Using equations of isostatic balance and simple assumptions of mass conservation, we estimate the elevation
                     and crustal thickness of the Hoh Xil Basin following Eocene to late Oligocene crustal shortening and compare
                     these results with local paleoelevation estimates. We assume several initial conditions for the lithosphere in
                     the northern Tibetan Plateau prior to deformation and test several possible modes of accommodating litho-
                     spheric deformation. We assume volume conservation (pure shear) and thus determine the crustal and litho-
                     spheric thickness that would result from the observed shortening. The amount of surface uplift that would
                     arise from the shortening and thickening is estimated using equations of isostatic balance [Heiskanen and
                     Moritz, 1967; England and Houseman, 1989]. In each case, we ﬁrst shorten the initial lithosphere by the short-
                     ening observed in the Fenghuoshan fold and thrust belt (24 ± 9%). We then explore various combinations of
                     lower crustal thickening and/or mantle lithosphere removal to match modern values of elevation and crustal
                     thickness in Hoh Xil Basin.

                     Inherent in our extrapolations of crustal shortening from the FFTB to the uplift history of the northern Tibetan
                     Plateau is the inference that percentage of shortening measured in the FFTB is regionally representative. As we
                     discuss previously, we consider the amount of shortening estimated from our cross section in the FFTB to be
                     representative of shortening across the Hoh Xil Basin. Furthermore, compiled Cenozoic shortening estimates
                     suggest that the average amount crustal shortening across the Tibetan Plateau north of the Tanggula Shan is
                     25.0 ± 10.7%, which is comparable to our estimates from the FFTB [Yakovlev and Clark, 2014].

                                                                                                  to modern foreland basin systems
                     prior to crustal shortening and thus between 0 and 1 km above sea level. Palynological data from the Hoh Xil
                     Basin suggest that Late Cretaceous to early Eocene sediments were deposited in a warm, arid climate and that
                     elevations remained below 2 km through the late Eocene, thus supporting our assumption of initial low eleva-
                     tion [Li and Yuan, 1990; Miao et al., 2015]. We also assume that the initial crustal thickness of the Hoh Xil Basin
                     was between 20 and 41 km. This thickness is less than the global average [Christensen and Mooney, 1995] but
                     consistent with hypothesis that the Songpan-Ganzi terrane is underlain by oceanic crust [Şengör and Hsü,
                     1984; Şengör, 1984; Bruguier et al., 1997] or extended continental crust [Burchﬁel et al., 1995]. Such an inferred
                     initial crustal thickness is also consistent with recent orogen-scale mass balance calculations that are able to
                     resolve discrepancies in the precollisional and modern orogenic volume with a 23–29 km initial Indo-Asian crus-
                     tal thickness [Yakovlev and Clark, 2014].
                     From our inferred range of initial crustal thicknesses and paleoelevations, we estimate that the lithosphere
                     beneath the northern Tibetan Plateau was initially between 23 and 166 km, based on isostatic calculations
                     [Heiskanen and Moritz, 1967; England and Houseman, 1989]. This reﬂects a broad range of potential initial condi-
                     tions, including scenarios in which the early lithosphere was almost entirely composed of crustal material, as well
                     as scenarios in which the pre-Eocene Hoh Xil Basin was underlain by a mantle lithospheric root up to 125 km thick.
                     Figure 10 shows the possible initial crustal and lithospheric thicknesses outlined in red and colored by isostatically
                     derived elevations. Additional explanation of assumptions and parameter values is available in Appendix C.

                     5.3. Results
                     Our results indicate that the amount of surface uplift attributable to 24 ± 9% shortening is between 0.4 and
                     1.6 km, leading to a postshortening elevation between 0.4 and 2.6 km, under the assumption that crustal
                     shortening documented in the upper crust is representative of the lithosphere as a whole (Figure 10 and
                     Table 5). This implies that the modern elevation (4.5–5.5 km) of the Hoh Xil Basin was not attained via
                     ~24% crustal shortening alone (Figure 10 and Table 5) and that other mechanisms that contribute to surface
                     uplift are required to attain modern elevations. Such mechanisms may include mantle root loss [Molnar et al.,
                     1993] and lower crustal thickening, whether by lower crustal ﬂow [Clark et al., 2005; Karplus et al., 2011; Jiang
                     et al., 2014] or preferential shortening and thickening of the lower crust and mantle lithosphere beneath a
                     midcrustal detachment [Isacks, 1988; Gubbels et al., 1993].
                     Modern crustal thickness (65–75 km) and modern surface elevation (4.5–5.5 km) in the northern Tibetan
                     Plateau are the two observables that can be used to constrain permissible model suites for our calculations
                     of isostatic balance [Braitenberg et al., 2000; Vergne et al., 2002; Wittlinger et al., 2004; Karplus et al., 2011].
                     Near-modern crustal thickness values (up to 60 km) can be produced from the observed ~24% crustal
                     thickening for a limited set of initial conditions (Figure 10). However, in order to match the modern eleva-
                     tion and lithospheric thicknesses [Vozar et al., 2014], these scenarios would require the removal of >85 km
                     of mantle lithosphere (Figure S6). Alternatively, we can isolate a subset of models that match modern sur-
                     face elevations following ~24% shortening, but these models result in crustal thicknesses that are 16 to
                     45 km thinner than observed (Figure 10). Higher magnitudes of crustal shortening, such as previous esti-
                     mates by Coward et al. [1988] and Wang et al. [2002], also result in lower than modern elevations because
                     thickening of the mantle lithosphere offsets some of the buoyancy gained by thickening the crust.
                     Furthermore, we can consider alternative initial conditions, such as initial crustal thickness up to 50 km
                     due to pre-Eocene shortening or initial elevations up to 2 km. However, for our basic assumption of pure
                     shear of the lithosphere, none of these alternative assumptions leads to improved ﬁts to crustal thickness
                     and surface elevation.

                                             We ﬁnd that the amount of mantle lithosphere removal needed to explain modern crustal thicknesses and
                                             elevations trades off with the amount of lower crustal thickening (Figure S6) and that mantle root loss and
                                             lower crustal thickening are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Indeed, for most possible initial conditions
                                             of lithospheric structure, combinations of both mantle lithosphere removal and crustal thickening are neces-
                                             sary to attain observed modern crust and lithosphere dimensions and surface elevations, in addition to the
                                             observed ~24% crustal shortening (Figure 10). Thus, our results permit both lower crustal thickening and
                                             mantle root loss to have occurred across northern Tibet, possibly simultaneously or at different times.
                                             Additional data such as from paleoelevation studies, volcanic geochemistry, or reﬁned constraints on
                                             lithospheric thickness beneath Tibet may eventually lead to improved discrimination of the role that these
                                             two mechanisms played in creating the modern Tibetan lithosphere.

                                             It is commonly recognized that the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes were deformed prior to collision and that
                                             crustal thickening may have lead to signiﬁcant elevation gain by ~50 Ma, in some ways analogous to the
                                             formation of the modern Altiplano-Puna orogenic plateau in South America (Figure 2) [Burg et al., 1983;
                                             Chang et al., 1986; England and Searle, 1986; Dewey et al., 1988, 1989; Murphy et al., 1997; Rowley and
                                             Currie, 2006; Kapp et al., 2003, 2005, 2007a, 2007b; DeCelles et al., 2007b; Volkmer et al., 2007, 2014; Polissar

                                             of the Lhasa and southern Qiangtang terranes was attained by ~50 Ma, absolute elevation estimates remain

                     south to the Tanggula Shan in the north (Figures 1 and 2) [Kapp et al., 2007b; Wang et al., 2008; Staisch et al.,
                     2014]. However, the modern Tibetan Plateau is roughly double the width of this proposed precollisional
                     deformation belt and a signiﬁcant fraction of postcollisional plateau expansion took place north of the
                     Tanggula Shan. In the following discussion, we focus on how and when the Tibetan Plateau evolved from
                     precollisional to modern dimensions, with speciﬁc attention to the evolution of the northern plateau.
                     6.1. Synthesis of Cenozoic Crustal Shortening Throughout the Himalayan-Tibetan Orogen
                     Our new data on the timing of deformation in the Fenghuoshan fold and thrust belt, combined with existing
                     observations of deformation in the northern Tibetan Plateau, suggest that crustal shortening initiated in the
                     northern Tibetan Plateau within ~10 Myr of the onset of the Indo-Asian collision and that deformation was
                     distributed over a broad swath of the northern plateau, from the Hoh Xil Basin to the southern Qilian Shan
                     (Figure 11) [Horton et al., 2002; Spurlin et al., 2005; Yin et al., 2008; Clark et al., 2010; Duvall et al., 2011;
                     Zhuang et al., 2011]. In southern and central Tibet, there is relatively little evidence for postcollisional shortening,
                     aside from reactivation of thrust faults near the Bangong-Nujiang Suture [Burg et al., 1983; England and Searle,
                     1986; Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al., 2003, 2005, 2007a, 2007b; DeCelles et al., 2007b; Volkmer et al., 2007, 2014],
                     suggesting that the majority of post-50 Ma shortening accommodated within the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen
                     was focused north of the Tanggula Shan or to the south of the Tibetan Plateau, in the Himalaya.
                     Flat-lying ~27 Ma basalts in the Hoh Xil Basin [Wu et al., 2008; Staisch et al., 2014], undeformed 28 Ma volcanic
                     rocks in the Yulinshan [Xu et al., 2013], and evidence for minimal postcollisional deformation observed in the
                     Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes [Burg et al., 1983; Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al., 2003, 2005, 2007a, 2007b; Ding
                     et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Lippert et al., 2011] suggest that upper crustal shortening of the Tibetan Plateau
                     was largely complete by the early Miocene (~24 Ma) and that continued convergence between India and
                     Eurasia must have been accommodated outboard of the Tibetan Plateau proper, such as in the Himalaya, in
                     the Qilian Shan, and in the northeastern plateau margin, or by the underthrusting of India beneath Asia and redis-
                     tribution of crust at depth. The ﬁrst possibility is consistent with the documented Miocene crustal shortening in
                     the Himalaya, the Qilian Shan-Nan Shan, and the western Qaidam Basin (Figure 11 and Table S8) [DeCelles et al.,
                     2001; Murphy et al., 1997; Searle et al., 2003; Yin et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2010; Craddock et al., 2011; Zhuang et al.,
                     2011], while evidence for the extent to which India has underthrust Asia remains controversial [e.g., Owens and
                     Zandt, 1997; Zhou and Murphy, 2005; Nábelek et al., 2009; Yue et al., 2012; Yakovlev and Clark, 2014].
                     6.2. Comparison of Isostatic Modeling Results With Paleoelevation Estimates
                     Recent work on deriving paleoelevations from paleobotanical evidence in the Hoh Xil Basin provides some
                     key constraints to compare with our isostatic estimates. Palynological evidence from the late Eocene
                     Yaxicuo Group indicates that these strata were deposited at moderate elevations, <2 km [Miao et al.,
                     2015], and plant fossils consist of coniferous, broad-leaved deciduous and subtropical tree species
                     [Q. Duan et al., 2007, 2008; Wu et al., 2008]. Paleobotanical evidence from Miocene Wudaoliang strata indi-
                     cates that paleoelevation was between 1.4 and 2.9 km at 17 Ma [Sun et al., 2015] and that the Miocene fossil
                     assemblage was dominated by drought- and cold-tolerant species [Q. Duan et al., 2007, 2008; Wu et al., 2008].
                     Moreover, lipid biomarkers suggest that there has been between 1.7 and 2.6 km of uplift between early
                     Eocene and Miocene time in the Hoh Xil Basin [Polissar et al., 2009].
                     Taken together, our isostatic models and the current paleoelevation data can be used to construct a tentative
                     elevation history for northern Tibet. We assumed that the Hoh Xil Basin originated at relatively low (<1 km)
                     elevations in Cretaceous to Eocene time, consistent with estimates from the Fenghuoshan and Yaxicuo
                     Group strata [Miao et al., 2015]. We postulate that crustal shortening in late Eocene to Oligocene time led
                     to surface elevations of no more than 2.6 km. This is consistent with paleobotanical evidence from the
                     Miocene Wudaoliang strata [Sun et al., 2015] and the Eocene to Miocene elevation change derived from lipid
                     biomarkers [Polissar et al., 2009]. High elevations (3.4–4.2 km) may have been attained in late Miocene time
                     but fall short of the 4.5–5.5 km elevations of the modern northern plateau and may be suggestive of post–
                     late Miocene uplift [Polissar et al., 2009]. Thus, on the basis of palynological and paleoelevation data, along
                     with the results of our isostatic calculations (Figure 10), we suggest that as much as 50% of the modern
                     elevation of the Hoh Xil Basin was attained after the late Oligocene cessation of crustal shortening [Q. Duan
                     et al., 2007, 2008; Wu et al., 2008; Polissar et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2013; Staisch et al., 2014].

                     6.3. A Two-Stage Uplift History for the Northern Tibetan Plateau
                     Both our structural observations from the Fenghuoshan fold and thrust belt, when interpreted in terms of
                     crustal thickening and isostatic response, and recent paleobotanical studies are consistent with a two-stage
                     uplift history of the Hoh Xil Basin. Uplift from low elevations (<1 km) to modest elevations (2–3 km) occurred
                     from late Eocene to late Oligocene time, coeval with observed crustal shortening in the FFTB. The attainment
                     of modern elevations (4.5–5.5 km) occurred after ~17 Ma [Q. Duan et al., 2007, 2008; Wu et al., 2008; Polissar
                     et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2015], substantially later than any signiﬁcant crustal shortening preserved in the region.
                     Evidence for lower crustal ﬂow contributing to the post-Oligocene uplift of the northern Tibetan Plateau is
                     found in present-day geophysical observations. Low shear wave velocities and high Poisson ratios in the
                     northern Tibetan Plateau are indicative of partial melt of the middle to lower crust [Owens and Zandt,
                     1997; Ding et al., 2003; Klemperer, 2006; Karplus et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2014]. Melt fractions within the
                     Songpan-Ganzi middle to lower crust are estimated to be between 10 and 21% [Le Pape et al., 2015].
                     Zones of potential partial melt under some parts of Tibet are estimated between 20 and 30 km thick
                     [Owens and Zandt, 1997; Klemperer, 2006; Karplus et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2014; Le Pape et al., 2015] and have
                     been argued to reﬂect a thick channel of partially molten, and potentially ﬂowing, lower crust beneath the
                     Hoh Xil Basin [Karplus et al., 2011; Le Pape et al., 2015]. The introduction of 20–30 km of partially molten crust
                     via lower crustal ﬂow, in combination with ~24% preexisting crustal shortening, would viably produce the
                     observed modern crustal thickness and elevations in the Hoh Xil Basin (Figure S6). Petrologic evidence that
                     the middle crust in the Qiangtang terrane was relatively hot, above 900°C, as early as the late Oligocene and
                     continued to increase in temperature until at least 3 Ma is consistent with uplift of the plateau in the absence
                     of upper crustal shortening in the Miocene or Pliocene [Hacker et al., 2000, 2014].
                     On the other hand, volcanism in the northern Tibetan Plateau, and the Hoh Xil Basin in particular, begins circa
                     27–28 Ma, coincident with the cessation of upper crustal shortening [Staisch et al., 2014; Yakovlev et al., 2015].
                     Maﬁc lavas erupted across this region carry a signal of melted mantle lithosphere [Yakovlev, 2015] and thus
                     may reﬂect partial (or even complete) removal of the mantle lithosphere from beneath the northern Tibetan
                     Plateau, perhaps triggered by instabilities associated with lithospheric thickening [England and Houseman,
                     1989]. Continuous volcanism across the northern Tibetan Plateau since the late Oligocene [McKenna and
                     Walker, 1990; Arnaud et al., 1992; Turner et al., 1993, 1996; Williams et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2006, 2014; Jiang
                     et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012; Yang and Ding, 2013; Staisch et al., 2014] suggests that mantle lithosphere
                     removal, and potential associated surface uplift (Figure S6), may have occurred throughout the late Cenozoic.
                     Lower crustal ﬂow and mantle root loss are not necessarily mutually exclusive processes, and maﬁc volcanism
                     driven by mantle lithosphere removal may be closely related to heating and partial melting of the lower crust.
                     The relative contribution of each of these processes to surface uplift in the Hoh Xil Basin remains unresolved,
                     but the present study reﬁnes the post-Oligocene timescale over which these processes were most likely to
                     have contributed to the lithospheric evolution and uplift of the northern Tibetan Plateau.

                     7. Conclusions
                     In this study we constrained the history of deformation and surface uplift within the Hoh Xil Basin. Our fault
                     gouge dating and thermochronologic modeling results independently agree on an early Eocene onset of crustal
                     shortening within the Hoh Xil Basin, and thermochronologic modeling elucidates the later Eocene to Oligocene
                     history of exhumation. Previously published volcanic ages from the Fenghuoshan fold and thrust belt indicate
                     that deformation ceased between ~34 and ~27 Ma. We construct and retrodeform a balanced cross section from
                     which we determine ~24% (~34 km) shortening over the full length of the Fenghuoshan fold and thrust belt.
                     Calculations of isostatic uplift indicate that elevation gain due to ~24% crustal shortening and thickening
                     does not account for the modern elevation of the Hoh Xil Basin, which suggests that additional mechanisms
                     for elevation gain in the absence of crustal shortening are likely. Simple mass balance indicates that the
                     observed shortening cannot account for the modern crustal thickness of the Hoh Xil Basin. Palynological
                     and paleoelevation data suggest that signiﬁcant surface uplift in the absence of upper crustal shortening
                     occurred after the Oligocene [Q. Duan et al., 2007, 2008; Polissar et al., 2009; Miao et al., 2015; Sun et al.,
                     2015]. Along with geophysical and petrological data in the northern Tibetan Plateau [Owens and Zandt,
                     1997; Hacker et al., 2000, 2014; Ding et al., 2003; Klemperer, 2006; Karplus et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2014; Le
                     Pape et al., 2015], our calculations are supportive of a model in which the modern elevation and crustal thick-
                     ness of the Hoh Xil Basin were attained via ~24% shortening followed by lower crustal ﬂow.

                     Together with previous work on the tectonic evolution of the Tibetan Plateau, this work suggests that con-
                     tinental collision between India and Eurasia induced distributed northward expansion of crustal shortening
                     throughout the northern Tibetan Plateau [Yin et al., 2002, 2008; Polissar et al., 2009; Clark et al., 2010; Duvall
                     et al., 2011]. By ~27 Ma, upper crustal shortening within the modern plateau interior ceased and paleoeleva-
                     tion was 2.6 km at most [Kapp et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b; Q. Duan et al., 2007, 2008; Polissar et al., 2009; Miao
                     et al., 2015]. Elevation gain continued in the northern Tibetan Plateau during Miocene time, with as much as
                     0.8 km surface uplift between 17 and 3 Ma [Polissar et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2015].


                     Appendix A: Bayesian Linear Regression
                     The Bayesian linear regression used in this study to obtain authigenic and detrital illite ages from fault gouge
                     data is a statistical analysis of linear ﬁt in the framework of Bayesian inference. The regression model requires
                     three main inputs: aliquot 40Ar/39Ar ages and illite concentrations, associated uncertainties in age and illite
                     concentration, and uniform prior bounds for slope and intercept values. The results of the regression model
                     are posterior relative probability distributions of the slope and intercept parameters.
                     Prior bounds were chosen to effectively limit the model space searched without limiting the results. We
                     conﬁrmed that prior bounds were not biasing posteriors by ensuring that prior bounds were outside the
                     5% bounds of the posterior range. We chose to run 106 models for each fault gouge sample in order to obtain
                     a well-distributed range in posterior parameter values.
                     The model uniformly searches the prior bounds to test the likelihood of parameter combinations in ﬁtting the
                     measured fault gouge data. The likelihood of each trial was computed based on the assumption that uncer-
                     tainties in x and y values of the measured data are Gaussian. Since we include uncertainty in illite concentra-
                     tions and 40Ar/39Ar ages, the total model likelihood is a product of likelihood in ﬁtting observed data. Thus, as
                     the distance between measured and modeled x or y values increases, the model likelihood decreases. The
                     trials were sampled from the posterior to return a normalized relative probability distribution for slope and
                     intercept values. We chose the linear ﬁt with the highest calculated likelihood as our best ﬁt model for each
                     fault gouge sample. The posterior distributions for parameter values for both fault gouge samples are roughly
                     Gaussian (Figure S4), such that the best ﬁt, most likely, mean, and median values for slope and intercept are
                     nearly indistinguishable. Authigenic and detrital age uncertainty is reported at the 95% conﬁdence interval.


                     Appendix B: Structural Interpretation, Shortening Calculations, and Error Propagation
                     B1. Interpretation and Fault and Décollement Geometries at Depth
                     The following provides a description and explanation of structural interpretations made to construct the
                     Fenghuoshan fold and thrust belt cross section presented in this work (Figure 9a). Structures are described from
                     north to south. The south facing limb of the northernmost anticline (Figure 9a) is well constrained by structural
                     data, and the approximate location of the fold axis is guided by new and existing geologic mapping [Kidd et al.,
                     1988; QBGMR, 1989a, 1989b]. The lack of mapped faulting at the surface of this features and the depth to
                     décollement suggest that the structure may be underlain by a thrust fault within the Triassic Jieza Group, which
                     is in roof thrust contact with the overlying Bayan Har Group (Figure 9a; fault block “a”). To the south, deformation
                     of the overlying Cretaceous to early Eocene Fenghuoshan Group strata in an associated syncline suggests that this
                     fold was likely active after the early Eocene. Along the northern portion of the transect, the Fenghuoshan Group
                     and underlying strata are generally obscured by the overlying deformed Yaxicuo Group, except near the axial
                     trace of anticlines (Figure 9a). We posit that regions of obscured predeformational strata are characterized by pig-
                     gyback basins where deposition of syntectonic strata was concentrated. We interpret the next small anticline to
                     the south to be a shallow, north directed thrust fault within the lower Fenghuoshan Group strata based on the
                     short distance over which the steep, south facing anticlinal limb changes to a gently dipping south directed fold
                     limb (Figure 9a). Just north of the NFBT, the upper Fenghuoshan Group strata are exposed in a small and steeply
                     dipping anticline, which we similarly interpret to be a shallow, north directed thrust fault at depth (Figure 9a).
                     Between NFBT and the small anticline to the north, geologic mapping (Figure 3a) shows Yaxicuo Group strata at
                     the surface, indicating that deformed Fenghuoshan Group strata within the NFBT footwall were largely eroded
                     prior to Yaxicuo Group deposition. Between the NFBT and EBT, we interpret the transition from predominantly
                     south dipping bedding orientations to tightly spaced folding in unit K2fnc and the lack of fault offset (Figure 9a;

                     fault block “g”) to result from northward displacement of the Triassic Jieza Group at depth (Figure 9a; fault block
                     “c”). West of our structural transect, the satellite imagery clearly shows south directed fault offset within the K2fnc
                     unit (Figure 3a); however, ﬁeld investigation found no clear offset in line of our structural transect, indicating that
                     this fault does not extend at depth and likely does not accommodate signiﬁcant displacement (Figure 9a).
                     Isopach data and geologic mapping indicate that there is considerable structural relief in the central portion
                     of the FFTB, which we interpret to result from duplexing of the Triassic Jieza Group at depth (Figure 9a; fault
                     blocks “d,” “e,” and “f”). An alternative explanation for the magnitude structural relief in the central FFTB is a
                     shallowing of the décollement depth. We interpret the broad syncline in the hanging wall of the SFT (Figure 9
                     a; fault block “i”) as the southward extent of the interpreted duplex structures. The folding of the SFT hanging
                     wall is likely the result of the SFT ramp-ﬂat geometry, in which we interpret the northernmost and southern-
                     most north facing synclinal limbs to be the locations of ramps at depth (Figures 3a and 9a; fault block “i”).
                     Along strike to the west of out structural transect, the Triassic Jieza Group is exposed in the hanging wall
                     of the SFT, indicating that it is involved in displacement along the SFT (Figure 9a).
                     The region between the south Fenghuoshan and Tuotuohe thrust faults is characterized by a broad expanse of
                     moderately to mildly deformed Tuotuohe and Yaxicuo Group sedimentary cover, from which we interpret a
                     relatively ﬂat décollement geometry at depth. The location of fold axes and strata exposed in the hanging wall
                     of the TT are used to interpret the ramp-ﬂat geometry of the TT at depth (Figures 3a and 9a, fault block “j”). The
                     hanging wall of the TT exhumed Triassic and Permian strata not mapped to the north (Figure 3a) which we
                     interpret as marine strata that was deposited on the Qiangtang Block prior to and possibly during Mesozoic
                     subduction along the Jinsha Suture [Yin and Nie, 1993; Zhou and Graham, 1996]. Near the cross section, the
                     Permian strata are mapped in contact with Triassic strata, which is undifferentiated by Kidd et al. [1988] but
                     deﬁned as Middle Triassic, rather than Jieza Group, by QBGMR [1989b]. Our mapping integrates both of pub-
                     lished maps in Figure 3a; however, it is also possible that the intervening Middle Triassic strata were postdepo-
                     sitionally eroded or absent from this locality. Accordingly, our structural transect includes both Middle Triassic
                     and Permian Wuli strata in the hanging wall of the TT (Figure 9a).

                     B2. Shortening Calculations and Error Propagation
                     To calculate original width (Wi), slight modiﬁcations were made to the equations presented in Judge and
                     Allmendinger [2011] to account for the complicated basal thrust geometry of our cross section. Instead of
                     assuming that the undeformed area can be approximated by a simple four-sided polygon, we subdivided
                     our total retrodeformed area (A) into four polygons (e.g., Figure 9b), with areas A1, A2, A3, and A4.
                     The area of subdivided polygons A1, A2, and A3 can be calculated using equations (B1)–(B3), based on values of
                     the corresponding polygon widths, W 1i , W 2i , and W 3i (Figure 9b and Table 3), which are known by measuring the
                     length of each polygon and the stratigraphic thicknesses measured at the area margins (Figure 9b and Table 3).

                                                                                      
                                                                               Tc þ Td

                     Using the calculated values of A1, A2, and A3 and the full area (A) (Table 3), which is known by measuring the
                     area of the deformed section using the AreaErrorProp program presented in Judge and Allmendinger [2011],
                     we can solve for A4 and calculate W 4i .

                     The four widths of each polygon are now known and can be used to calculate the full initial width (Wi). The
                     magnitude of shortening can be calculated from the initial and ﬁnal cross-section transect widths, Wi and Wf,
                     respectively, to obtain the magnitude of shortening.

                     To assess the uncertainty of our shortening estimate, we adapted the error analysis methods of Judge and
                     Allmendinger [2011] to our cross section. The errors associated from our measured area (A) were obtained
                     using the AreaErrorProp program [Judge and Allmendinger, 2011] into which we enter the uncertainty in
                     measured stratigraphic thicknesses at the transect margins and the uncertainty in the location of polygon
                     vertices. The uncertainty in the stratigraphic thickness for each unit was determined by assessing the varia-
                     bility in published stratigraphic columns [Zhong, 1989; Ji, 1994; QBGMR, 1989a, 1989b; Liu et al., 2001, 2003;
                     Liu and Wang, 2001; An et al., 2004]. The depth to décollement was assessed as the stratigraphic thickness
                     of units involved in Cenozoic deformation along the transect. The uncertainty in stratigraphic thicknesses
                     and the z component of the polygon vertices were obtained from the range in reported stratigraphic thick-
                     nesses for each unit (Table 3) [QBGMR, 1989a, 1989b; Liu et al., 2001]. The uncertainty of the x component of
                     polygon vertices was set at an estimated value (0.25 km). The values of uncertainty in width measurements
                     (W 1i , W 2i , and W 3i ) were also set at an estimated value of 10% of the width measurements (Table 3). The values
                     of uncertainty in calculated variables were obtained by propagating errors in quadrature.


                     Appendix C: Surface Uplift due to Crustal Thickening and Mantle Root Loss
                     C1. Parameters Used and Isostatic Balance
                     We use a range of initial crustal thicknesses to explore a broad parameter space, between 20 and 41 km.
                     Based on isostatic balance [Heiskanen and Moritz, 1967; England and Houseman, 1989] and the assumed
                     low initial elevation, the mantle lithospheric thickness may have ranged between 3 and 125 km. The relative
                     densities of the crust and mantle lithosphere vary depending on the thickness of the layers. The density of the
                     underlying asthenosphere is invariant to lithospheric thickness. To calculate crustal, mantle lithospheric, and
                     asthenospheric densities, we assume that the temperature at the base of the lithosphere is 1333°C, that the
                     coefﬁcient of thermal expansion is 3.4 × 105 K1, and that the crustal and mantle densities at 0°C are
                     2850 km m3 and 3330 km m3, respectively. We also assume a linear geothermal gradient from the base
                     of the lithosphere to the surface. Average densities of the crust and mantle lithosphere are then calculated
                     based on the average temperature of each respective layer. We note that the amount of surface uplift and
                     the range of crustal thicknesses for an initial elevation of 0–1 km are dependent on the chosen density struc-
                     ture of the lithosphere.
                     To calculate the elevation, we balance the continental lithospheric column to a mid-oceanic ridge column
                     with water depth of 2.5 km and density of 1030 km m3, oceanic crust of 5 km and density 2850 km m3
                     [Christensen and Wilkins, 1982], and asthenospheric density similar to the continental lithospheric column.
                     By increasing the crustal density, the maximum allowable initial crustal thickness increases noticeably and
                     the amount of surface uplift decreases slightly. Here we match the majority of trials to the global average
                     crustal density of 2830 kg m3 [Christensen and Mooney, 1995]. We consider the global average to be a best
                     estimate for the purposes of our isostatic calculations, although we recognize that the paleodensity structure
                     of the Hoh Xil Basin may have included denser crust, since the Songpan-Ganzi terrane may be underlain by
                     oceanic or extended continental crust [Şengör and Hsü, 1984; Şengör, 1984; Burchﬁel et al., 1995; Bruguier et al.,
                     1997], and that the modern crustal density estimate from gravity anomalies is much less that our modeled
                     range, possibly due to the heating effects of Neogene magmatism [He et al., 2014]. Regardless of the crustal
                     density, our calculations suggest that ~28% shortening is not sufﬁcient to attain modern values of crustal
                     thickness in the Hoh Xil Basin.

                     C2. Isostatic Uplift in the Absence of Shortening
                     We quantify the amount of elevation gain due to lower crustal ﬂow, preferential thickening of the lower
                     crust and mantle lithosphere, and removal of the mantle lithosphere by calculating the isostatic response
                     to thickening the crust from our postshortening crustal thickness to the modern crustal thickness in Hoh
                     Xil Basin and to removal of the mantle lithosphere. In all cases, we limit our ﬁnal results to match the
                     modern elevation (4.5–5.5 km), crustal thickness (65–70 km) [Braitenberg et al., 2000; Vergne et al., 2002;

                                              Hoh Xil Basin.
                                              We consider two possible models of crustal thickening: (1) we test the effects of preferential shortening of the
                                              ductile midlower crust and mantle lithosphere by uniformly thickening the lithosphere below 15 km and (2)
                                              we test the effects of lower crustal ﬂow by thickening only the crust while the mantle lithosphere retains
                                              its postshortening thickness. In the ﬁrst thickening scenario, we assume a value of 15 km as the depth of
                                              the brittle-ductile transition, at which point the upper and lower crusts are decoupled and the lower crust
                                              can deform without leaving surﬁcial evidence of strain [Gans, 1987; Chamoli et al., 2014]. We calculate the sur-
                                              face uplift due to mantle root loss by removing mantle root material below a depth of 80–120 km, based on
                                              the a range of lithospheric thickness proposed for the northern Tibetan Plateau [Vozar et al., 2014]. All results
                                              are plotted in Figure S6 and indicate that all proposed mechanisms of uplift in the absence of shortening are
                                              capable of reproducing the current dimensions of the northern Tibetan Plateau.

are regions where extension and compression have occurred leading to the present geometry. They emphasize the stepped pull-
apart geometry. Large normal faulting along the north Cinarcik escarpment (2 km extension) and signiﬁcant thrusting at the
Ganos bend (0.5 km contraction) are expected. Red arrows show the direction of motion of the southern block relative to Eurasia.
The direction of Anatolia/Eurasia motion deduced from GPS measurements is also shown (purple arcs constructed with Euler pole

geological markers (in dashed blue) restored and the corresponding displacement ﬁeld (slightly modiﬁed from Armijo et al., 1999).
The Anatolia–Eurasia direction of motion obtained in the previous reconstruction by Armijo et al. (1999) was, within errors, the
same as that deduced from GPS (McClusky et al., 2000). To simplify, the Anatolia/Eurasia motion is taken strictly parallel to the
GPS model [purple arcs as in (a)]; however, the average Anatolia/Eurasia velocity deduced across Marmara for the past 5 Myr is
17 mm yr)1, somewhat less than the 22 ± 3 mm yr)1 determined using GPS (Kahle et al., 2000). Black vectors are relative to the
northern block (Eurasia); red vectors are relative to the adjacent block. Vectors inside the pull-apart deviate from Anatolia/Eurasia
circles because reconstruction requires slip partitioning. The Submarine NMFS is indicated by grey lines and the northern frame of
A is rotated to its initial position. The reconstruction shows that signiﬁcant, long-term, oblique extension has occurred over the
NMFS. The direction of motion across it (large red arrows, locally referred to Eurasia) is indistinguishable from that of the
shorter-term motion determined in (a). This is because the two reconstructions (a) and (b) require primarily right-lateral slip along
the Izmit and Ganos faults.

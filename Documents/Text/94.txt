                                            Previously, Taylor [1910] and Wegener [1912] suggested some kind of left-lateral transform fault along the
                                            Nares Strait, nowadays proposed as the Wegener Fault [Le Pichon et al., 1977; Taylor, 1910; Wegener, 1912;
                                            Wilson, 1963]. This fault is supported by recent studies [von Gosen et al., 2008; Greiner and Neugebauer,
                                            2013; Saalmann et al., 2005; Tessensohn et al., 2008].
                                            During the early Eocene simultaneous seaﬂoor spreading in the Labrador Sea and Bafﬁn Bay in the West and
                                            North Atlantic in the east of Greenland was active as well as in the Eurasian Basin [Kristoffersen and Talwani,
                                            1977; Piepjohn et al., 2013; Srivastava, 1978]. In this time period the tectonic regime at the NW Greenland
                                            margin changed from transform motion to compression (Eurekean Deformation) [Piepjohn et al., 2013;
                                            Srivastava and Tapscott, 1986]. After the late Eocene (anomaly C13) seaﬂoor spreading in the Labrador
                                            Sea and Bafﬁn Bay ceased [Srivastava, 1978] and deformation along the west Greenland margin stopped.
                                            As a result Greenland became attached to the North American Plate [Tessensohn et al., 2008].
                                            However, the necessity of a transform fault compensating the relative motion between Greenland and
                                            North America is highly disputed and in particular land geological data do not support this hypothesis

                      the data are augmented by older unpublished data from 2001 [Jackson et al., 2001] and published data
                      [Jackson et al., 2006].


                      2. Methods
                      A ﬁrst data set was acquired in 2001 on the western side of the Kane Basin (PASSAGE project [Jackson et al.,
                      2001]). This data set was recorded with six channels only (150 m cable length) and three GI-Guns with 615 in3
                      (10 L) in total [Jackson et al., 2001]. The limited cable length did not allow a reasonable multiple attenuation.
                      The 2010 geophysical data were acquired during the ARK-XXV/3 Polarstern expedition. Because of the prevail-
                      ing sea ice coverage of up to 6/10, only a short 750 m streamer with 60 channels without lead-in cable and
                      stretch section and without depth control was deployed in order to acquire two multichannel seismic
                      (MCS) lines (Figure 1). As signal source we used 4 G-Guns with 520 in3 (8.5 L) each. Accompanying, we
                      deployed nine sonobuoys of which eight worked ﬁne and broadcasted data. In addition, we recorded
                      multibeam and sediment echosounder data, gravity, and airborne magnetic data.
                      The quality of the MCS data was limited because of the above mentioned limitations. Especially, seaﬂoor
                      multiples and bubble signals from the source could not be removed completely and caused low-frequency
                      horizontal events superimposed on the primary reﬂections. The processing sequence included designature,
                      band-pass ﬁlter, surface related multiple elemination (SRME), ﬁlter, predictive deconvolution, velocity analy-
                      sis, true amplitude recovery, normal moveout correction, stacking, and migration. Because of the limited
                      streamer length, the velocity control was locally conﬁrmed by sonobuoy measurements and by the analysis
                      of the refractions that were recorded with the streamer cable (Figure 2).
                      For the analysis of the refractions in the streamer cable, the corresponding arrival times were picked on
                      every ﬁfth shot gather and used to calculate the linear regression. All resulting velocities are imaged in

                                        Ray tracing was performed for line BGR10-217 on selected shot gathers (mean distance 1 km) to obtain
                                        reliable velocity information. The ﬁrst arrivals of three sonobuoys were also part of the ray tracing. The result-

                                        magnetic data were processed and plotted on top of the seismic data (Figures 3 and 4). Seismic data of the
                                        PASSAGE2001 expedition (Nares01-21 and Nares01-21A) were reprocessed and plotted in Figure 3.

                                        The combined seismic lines Nares01-21, Nares01-21A, and BGR10-316 represent a NW-SE cross section through

                                        Starting in the NW, the lines Nares01-21 and Nares01-21A show a series of westward tilted horizons that

                                        and a second series of NW tilted sedimentary reﬂections, again, eroded at the seaﬂoor. A prominent anticline

                      structure at the seaﬂoor marks the transition to an area with almost no penetration of the seismic signal. In
                      addition, the analysis of the seismic velocities shows a transition of the p wave velocity (vp) of approximately
                      2500 ms 1 to very high 4800–6000 ms 1 at this point (shot point (SP) 1900, line BGR10-316) (Figure 2d).
                      A small patch of slower velocities between SP200 and SP400 is related to slower apparent velocity due
                      to a slope angle of 2°. These velocities and the depth of the refractor are conﬁrmed by ray tracing of the sono-
                      buoy data (Figure 2c). The area of high velocities extends to the end of the line close to the Greenland
                      coast (Figure 2). The seaﬂoor is intersected by some normal faults. At the SE end of the line, the seaﬂoor drops
                      to approximately 500 m depth in good agreement with the trough that can be observed in the bathymetric
                      map (Figure 1).
                      3.1.2. Line BGR10-317
                      Line BGR10-317 is a NNE-SSW line in the central Kane Basin extending from the entrance of the Kennedy
                      Channel in the NNE to the coast of Ingleﬁeld Land in the SSE (Figures 1 and 4). Similar to the combined
                      NW-SE line (Figure 3), we can observe a seaﬂoor with three terrace-like levels in the NNE (Figure 4). The area
                      where sediment horizons can be observed correlates with the area where seismic velocities are in the range
                      of 2400–2900 ms 1. SSW of SP2000 vp increase to 4800 ms 1 and SSW of SP2850 further to 5500 ms 1 similar
                      as already observed in the eastern part of the line BGR10-316 (Figure 2d).
                      The low-velocity seismic unit overlays to some extent the high-velocity seismic unit (Figure 4). The MCS data

                      shot gather refractions between SP250 and 2000 (Figures 2e–2g). The ray tracing showed that this boundary
                      is at depth of approximately 600 m near SP1000, while 20 km to the south (SP1800) it is as shallow as 400 m
                      (Figure 4). In the southern part of the line it crops out at the seaﬂoor. The sediment echosounder data
                      (dominant frequency 4 kHz) reveal another conspicuous difference between the eastern and western parts
                      of the Kane Basin (see insets in Figures 3 and 4). The seaﬂoor topography is very rough on the western side,
                      built by randomly distributed blocks or deep iceberg scours in the range of ±5 m. Farther to the east the
                      seaﬂoor is smoother with some smaller boulders or scours.
                      3.2. Magnetics and Gravimetry
                      The airborne magnetic and shipborne gravity data are shown as composite plots on top of the MCS data
                      (Figures 3 and 4). The magnetic data set shows, in general, higher-amplitude variations in the southeastern
                      side of the Kane Basin. Toward the tilted sedimentary basin in the northwest, the amplitude variations decline
                      continuously (Figure 3). Along the NNE-SSW line (BGR10-317, Figure 4), the magnetic amplitude variations are
                      slightly increasing on a low level in SSW direction.
                      The free-air gravity is negative all over the Kane Basin area. The maximum values of 75 mGal occur on the
                      eastern slope of the bathymetric depression (SP1-200, line BGR10-316) near Ingleﬁeld Land (Figure 3). Toward
                      the tilted sedimentary basin, the free-air gravity declines further to a level of 140 mGal. On line BGR10-317
                      (Figure 4) the free-air gravity also decreases considerably to the northwest, similar to line BGR10-316 (Figure 3).

                      4. Interpretation and Discussion
                      Because of the unpredictable sea ice situation in the Kane Basin, only few MCS seismic data were published,
                      mainly located at the coast of Ellesmere Island [Jackson et al., 2006, 2001]. The IBCAO bathymetric map
                      [Jakobsson et al., 2012] shows a bathymetric depression at the coastline to Ingleﬁeld Land with water depths
                      of approximately 500 m (Figure 1). Toward the central part of the Kane Basin the seaﬂoor rises to a plateau
                      with an average water depth of approximately 200 m. Line BGR10-316 (Figure 3) crosses the Kane Basin from
                      SE to NW. From SP1 to SP1700 no internal layers can be resolved, neither by MCS nor by sonobuoy data. Ray
                      tracing shows a unit with very high vp of approximately 4800 to 6000 m s 1 directly below the seaﬂoor. High-
                      resolution sediment echosounder data suggest that small kinks observed in the MCS data are caused by
                      extensional normal faulting of the high-velocity unit (see inset in Figure 3), possibly a result of postglacial
                      rebound. The transparent seismic appearance and vp between 4800 and 6000 m s 1 allow an interpretation
                      as gneissic, marble, or granitic material that occurs in the Ingleﬁeld marble belt in the southern prolongation
                      of the Kane Basin (Figure 1) [Dawes et al., 2000; Harrison et al., 2011]. vp of gneiss, granite, and marble start
                      with 4500 to 5100 ms 1, ~5700 ms 1, and ~5100 ms 1, respectively, at 10 bars. At 1 kbar vp is as high as
                      5900 to 6100 ms 1, ~6.210 ms 1, and 6600 ms 1 for gneiss, granite, and marble, respectively [Birch, 1960;
                      Kearey et al., 2002]. As the material is exposed at the seaﬂoor, the vp is probably slightly lower because of

                                          weathering. Thus, the high-velocity unit could represent the offshore prolongation of the Paleoproterozoic
                                          crust of the Greenland Ingleﬁeld Mobile Belt [Dawes et al., 2000; Harrison et al., 2011]. Toward the northwes-
                                          tern part of Line BGR10-316 a sedimentary basin with NW tilted and eroded sedimentary strata is imaged.
                                          This sedimentary basin is characterized by much lower vp of 2500 ms 1 to 3000 ms 1 a free-air gravity mini-
                                          mum and very weak magnetic anomalies. At the transition between the sedimentary basin with low vp in the
                                          west and the high-velocity unit in the east an anticlinal structure is imaged. The extent of the sedimentary
                                          basin is in good agreement with the Cretaceous-Cenozoic Franklin Pierce Basin mapped by Harrison [2006]
                                          and Harrison et al. [2011]. However, our data do not resolve a Mesoproterozoic to Jurassic unit within the
                                          Kane Basin as suggested by Harrison et al. [2011]. The anticlinal structure that correlates with the termination
                                          of the tilted sedimentary strata could be an expression of strike-slip faulting that is observed at the Judge
                                          Daly Promontory left-lateral strike-slip fault system (Figures 1 and 5) [Saalmann et al., 2005]. Toward the
                                          SSW of line BGR10-317 (Figure 4) we observe sedimentary strata with lower vp on top of the high-velocity unit
                                          from SP1 to SP2150. The ray tracing of sonobuoy data images this high-velocity unit at depth between 400
                                          and 600 m (Figure 4). The transition from the Cretaceous-Cenozoic unit to the Paleoproterozoic unit spreads
                                          over a long distance because we cross the boundary obliquely. Line BGR10-317 is subparallel to the eastern
                                          limit of the Franklin Pierce Basin (Figure 5). From SP2150 to the SSW end of line BGR10-317 only the
                                          Paleoproterozoic high-velocity unit can be observed. On the northern extent of line BGR10-317 (north of
                                          SP1200) the free-air gravity decreases similar to line BGR10-316, pointing to the presence of a deeper
                                          Cretaceous to Cenozoic basin (please compare top frames of Figures 3 and 4). The combined interpretation
                                          of lines BGR10-316 and Nares01-21 and Nares01-21A enables us to derive a model of a NW-SE cross section of
                                          the Kane Basin, Nares Strait (Figure 5). Starting in the southeast we observe the Paleoproterozoic unit without
                                          major internal structure but affected by extension. Whether or not the 350 m to 450 m deep bathymetric
                                          depression is a result of extension or probably glacial erosion is not evident from our data. Toward the coast
                                          of Ellesmere Island we ﬁnd a series of tilted reﬂections probably caused by the eroded Cretaceous to
                                          Cenozoic sedimentary strata of the Franklin Pierce Basin [Harrison et al., 2011].

                                           At the transition to the Franklin Pierce Basin, anticlinal structures (SP400, 580 line Nares01-21A, and SP1900
                                           line BGR10-316) point to transpression-like deformation between the almost undisturbed Paleoproterozoic
                                           crust and the highly deformed Ellesmere Island crust which are probably the prolongation of the left-lateral
                                           strike-slip faulting known from the nearby Judge Daly Promontory [Saalmann et al., 2005; Tessensohn et al.,
                                           2008]. Although there are indications for strike-slip faulting, the positions of the faults do not support a
                                           pull-apart development of the Kane Basin. However, we observe the contact between the tilted and
                                           deformed sedimentary strata of the Eurekan fold belt with the regular and undeformed Paleoproterozoic unit
                                           of Greenland within the Kane Basin. Thus, we can infer that this contact between the deformed (green colors
                                           in Figure 5) and undeformed sedimentary strata (red colors in Figure 5) represents the Greenland-North
                                           America plate boundary which was previously mapped at the western edge of the Franklin Pierce Basin
                                           [Harrison, 2006].

                                           The sharp transition of the deformed Cretaceous-Cenozoic sedimentary strata to undeformed Paleoproterozoic
                                           crust along the plate boundary of Greenland and North America can be explained by a transform fault.
                                           Following this approach, this fault and plate boundary can be considered as a relic of the Wegener Fault.
                                           However, because of the Eurekan orogeny, this ancient strike-slip fault was overprinted by compression
                                           and thrusting.


                                           5. Conclusions
                                           The geophysical data of the ARK-XXV/3 and the Nares01 expeditions give evidence that the Kane Basin did
                                           not develop as a pull-apart basin. Moreover, the data show that the Kane Basin can be divided into two struc-
                                           tural units. The eastern part is characterized by a single, mostly undeformed unit likely of Paleoproterozoic
                                           age that is interpreted as the subsea prolongation of the Ingleﬁeld Mobile Belt. The western part of the
                                           Kane Basin is dominated by westward tilted sedimentary strata of the Franklin Pierce Basin. Our data indicate
                                           an abrupt transition between the Paleoproterozoic platform and the tilted sedimentary strata consistent with
                                           the plate boundary between Greenland and North America. It can be interpreted as an ancient transpression
                                           fault. The plate boundary between Greenland and North America can be considered as a relic of the Wegener
                                           Fault, later overprinted by the Eurekan orogeny.

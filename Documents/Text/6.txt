          Abstract. – The seaward extension of onshore formations and structures were previously almost unknown in Provence.
          The interpretation of 2D high-resolution marine seismic profiles together with the integration of sea-bottom rock sam-
          ples provides new insights into the stratigraphic, structural and paleogeographic framework of pre-Messinian Salinity
          Crisis (MSC) deposits of the Provence continental shelf. Seven post-Jurassic seismic units have been identified on seis-
          mic profiles, mapped throughout the offshore Provence area and correlated with the onshore series. The studied marine
          surface and sub-surface database provided new insights into the mid and late Cretaceous paleogeography and structural
          framework as well as into the syn– and post-rift deformation in Provence. Thick (up to 2000 m) Aptian-Albian series
          whose deposition is controlled by E-W-trending faults are evidenced offshore. The occurrence and location of the Upper
          Cretaceous South-Provence basin is confirmed by the thick (up to 1500 m) basinal series downlaping the Aptian-Albian
          unit. This basin was fed in terrigenous sediments by a southern massif (“Massif Méridional”) whose present-day relict is
          the Paleozoic basement and its sedimentary cover from the Sicié imbricate. In the bay of Marseille, thick syn-rift
          (Rupelian to Aquitanian) deposition occurred (>1000 m). During the rifting phase, syn-sedimentary deformations con-
          sist of dominant N040 to N060 sub-vertical faults with a normal component and N050 drag-synclines and anticlines.
          The syn-rift and early post-rift units (Rupelian to early Burdigalian) are deformed and form a set of E-W-trending en
          echelon folds that may result from sinistral strike-slip reactivation of N040 to N060 normal faults during a N-S com-
          pressive phase of early-to-mid Burdigalian age (18-200Ma). Finally, minor fault reactivation and local folding affect
          post-rift deposits within a N160-trending corridor localized south of La Couronne, and could result from a later,
          post-Burdigalian and pre-Pliocene compressive phase.

          Résumé. – Le prolongement en mer des formations et des structures provençales était jusqu’alors largement inconnu.
          L’interprétation de profils de sismique-réflexion marine 2D et l’intégration de dragages et carottages du fond-marin ont
          permis d’apporter des éléments nouveaux concernant le cadre stratigraphique, structural et paléogéographique des dé-
          pôts anté-Messiniens du plateau continental de Provence. Cinq unités sismiques post-Jurassiques et anté-Messiniennes
          ont été identifiées sur les profils sismiques, cartographiées à travers le plateau continental et corrélées avec les séries af-
          fleurant à terre. Une épaisse unité apto-albienne (jusqu’à 2000 m) dont le dépôt est contrôlé par des failles E-W a été
          mise en évidence en mer. L’existence d’un bassin subsident au Crétacé supérieur sur le plateau continental de Provence
          a été confirmée par le développement d’une épaisse série de bassin (jusqu’à 1500 m) reposant en downlap sur
          l’Apto-Albien. Le socle métamorphique de l’écaille de Sicié et sa couverture sédimentaire peut être considéré comme
          une relique allochtone du « Massif Méridional » ayant alimenté le Bassin sud-provençal en éléments terrigènes au Cré-
          tacé supérieur. Dans la rade de Marseille, une épaisse unité syn-rift (Rupélien à Aquitanien) a été mise en évidence
          (>1000 m), structurée en une série de synformes en échelon d’axe E-W et affectée par des failles d’orientation domi-
          nante N040 à N060. Sur le flanc sud des synformes, la formation de plis d’axe N050 est associée à une déformation
          syn-sédimentaire. La formation des synformes en échelon d’axe E-W résulterait d’une réactivation en décrochement des
          failles N040 à N060 pendant une phase de compression N-S dont l’âge est compris entre le Burdigalien inférieur et
          moyen (18-20 Ma). Enfin, les dépôts post-rift sont affectés par des déformations mineures (réactivation de failles et plis
          associés), le long d’un couloir d’orientation N160 à l’ouest de la baie de Marseille, attribuables à une phase de compres-
          sion post-burdigalienne et anté-pliocène.

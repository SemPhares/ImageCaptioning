         A resistivity survey was carried out to study the groundwater potential in Palar Sub-Basin Walajabad Block,
Tamilnadu, India, such as resistivity, depth and thickness by which water can be obtained. The geo-electrical methods
used in the survey are Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) with the aim of determining groundwater potential area. The
110 VES points were conducted using the Schlumberger Configuration in the entire study area. The instrument used is
ABEM Terrameter SAS 1000. The VES data were interpreted using IX1Dv2 software which showed that the area is
composed of top soil, clay, sandy clay, sand gravel, weathered genies, jointed genies and massive charnockite. The
curves are prominently of A, Q, K and H type indicating the presence of three layers followed by combination of
curves AK, KH, HK, HA, QH, AA, AH and KA indicating the four layers followed by combination of curves KHA,
HKH, KQH, AKH, KHK, HKQ and AAK indicating the presence of five layers sub-surface layers. Interpretation
reveals the number of subsurface layers, their thickness and their water bearing capacity within the study area. The best
layer which acts as the good aquifer of Walajabad block is the H type and H Combination type occur in the study area
except hard rock terrain. H type curve indicate the good aquifer in the study area. The resistivity varying from 0.565
Ωm to 39174.4 Ωm and thickness from 0.105 m to 94.91 m.
Keywords: Vertical Electrical Sounding, Resistivity, Thickness, Depth, Type Curve, Groundwater and Aquifer.
INTRODUCTION
         The electrical resistivity technique involves the measurement of the apparent resistivity of soils and rock as a
function of depth or position. The most common electrical technique needed in hydrogeologic and environmental
investigations is vertical electrical soundings (resistivity sounding). During resistivity surveys, current is injected into
the each through a pair of current electrodes, and the potential difference is measured between a pair of current
electrodes, and the potential electrodes. The bulk average resistivity of all soils and rock influencing the current. It is
calculated by dividing the measured potential difference by the input current and multiplying by a geometric factor
specific to the array being used and electrode spacing (AAA Zohdy, 1974).
        In a resistivity sounding the distance between the current electrodes and the potential electrodes is
systematically increased, thereby yielding information on subsurface resistivity from successively greater depth. The
variation of resistivity with the depth is modeled using forward and inverse modeling computer software. The vertical
sounding method was chosen for this study because the instrument is simple, field logistics are easy and straight
forward while the analysis of data is less tedious and economical (A.N.Amadi, 2012). It also has capability to
distinguish between saturated and unsaturated layers.
         In a resistivity sounding the distance between the current electrodes and the potential electrodes is
systematically increased, thereby yielding information on subsurface resistivity from successively greater depth. The
variation of resistivity with the depth is modeled using forward and inverse modeling computer software. The
Schlumberger method has a greater penetration than the Wenner. In resistivity method, Wenner configuration
discriminates between resistivities of different geoelectric lateral layers while the Schlumberger configuration is used
for the depth layers (J.A.Olowofela, 2005). Geoelectric method is regularly used in determination of depth, thickness
and boundary of an aquifer (G.O. Omosuyi, 2007, M.I. Ismailmohamaden, 2005)in determination of groundwater
potential (J.O.Oseji et.al. 2005). The investigation of alluvial aquifers with large resistivity contacts by Gnanasundar D
and Elango L, 1999, Identification of the presence and location of a leachate plume, delineation of the groundwater

alternative method for acquiring hydraulic parameters and processes data in order to adequately characterize flow in

hard rock aquifers (M.O.K’orowe, 2012) Resistivity value in sedimentary rocks are also controlled by parameters such
as water contents, salinity, texture, matrix conductivity and the presence of clay materials (C.N. Nwankwo and
G.O.Emujakporue, 2012).
The objective of this research paper is to find useful information on subsurface hydrogeological conditions of the study
area such as aquifer resistivity, aquifer thickness, depth and groundwater quality at Palar Basin, Walajabad Block by
using Vertical Electrical Sounding.
STUDY AREA
        In this research project the study area selected is Walajabad block of Kancheepuram District, Palar sub basin.
As per Groundwater Estimating Committee (GEC), 2009 the Walajabad block has been categorized as overexploited
block. Palar river is the major river draining across the district from West to East, and the river is a seasonal in nature.
As the surface water drying on, the groundwater has become the main source for irrigation and drinking water sectors.
The study area is predominantly underlain by hard rocks, sedimentary and alluvium deposits and hence because of
heterogeneity in geological formation a suitable methodology is required to identify groundwater potential zones. The
areal extent of the study area is 325 Km2 and lies between the geopgraphical co-ordinates of Latitude 13˚14’12” -
12˚15’38”and Longitude 79˚30’37” and 80˚30’42”.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
         The resistivity technique examines horizontal and vertical discontinuities in the electrical properties of the
ground. It measures earth resistivity by passing an electrical current into the ground and measuring the resulting
potentials created. This method involves the supply of direct current or low-frequency alternating current into the
ground through a pair of electrodes and the measurement of the resulting potential through another pair of electrodes
(potential electrodes) (AAA Zohdy et.al. 1974). Because the current is known and the potential can be measured an
apparent resistivity can be calculated. The apparent resistivity of the subsurface material is a function of the magnitude
of the current, the recorded potential difference and the geometry of the electrode array used. The current electrodes
spacing (AB) increases after each reading while the potential electrodes spacing (MN) increases only when deemed
necessary and controlled by the relation AB/2 ≥ 5MN/2 as required by the Schlumberger array. For Schlumberger
soundings (Fig. 2). This survey used ABEM SAS 1000 Terrameter, Sweden. Then, the sounding curves were
interpreted to determine the apparent resistivity and thicknesses of the subsurface layers. Interpretation was used with
IX1Dv2 software.

                      Figure.2. Schlumberger Sounding Or Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES)




A total number of 110 Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) points were carried out in the Walajabad block at
Kancheepuram in Tamilnadu, India. The maximum of outer current electrode spacing is 200 m. Then the inner
potential electrode maximum spacing is 10 m. The apparent resistivity data are associated with varying depths relative
to the distance between the current and potential electrodes and can be interpreted qualitatively and quantitatively in
terms of a lithologic and/or geohydrologic model. In the qualitative interpretation method the shape of the field curve is
observed to assess the number of layers and their resistivity. In the quantitative interpretation method true resistivity ‘ρ’
and layer thickness ‘h’ as the fundamental characteristics of a geoelectric layer are obtained. The quantitative
interpretation of VES curves in this study was done by the well–known method of curves matching. In curves matching
technique, the field VES curves are compared with set of theoretical curves to obtain ‘ρ’ and ‘h’ (M.Mathizhagan et.al
2012 & 2013).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
         Qualitative interpretation of VES curves: For qualitative interpretation method, the shape of the field curve is
observed to assess the number of layers and their resistivity. It gives information about the number of layers with their
continuity through area and reflects the degree of homogeneity or heterogeneity of an individual layer. Figure 3, 4 and
5 shows examples of resistivity sounding curves in the study area with three, four and five layers respectively. In this
study area, three geological formations namely alluvium, sedimentary and hard rock are present. Totally, 110 Vertical
Electrical Sounding (VES) points have been covered with 25, 58 and 27 points respectively. Alluvium occurs in the
north and south end of the study area. Hard rock followed by south side alluvium formation towards north. Then
sedimentary followed by north side alluvium formation towards south. These soundings are characterized by relatively
high resistivity values in the first layer (AB~8m) reflecting dry zone for the entire study area. But the difference are
clear in the second and third layer (AB > 8m) reflecting the groundwater on the geophysical parameters (resistivity) as
the variation in the depths of the layers and their nature.
       The form of the geoelectrical sounding curves throughout the study area are considerably of the types A, Q, K,
H, AK, KH, HK, HA, QH, AA, AH, KA, KHA, HKH, KQH, AKH, KHK, HKQ and AAK. The interpretive models for
each VES station as well as the percentage relative Root Mean Square (RMS) errors which provide quantitative
assessment on the quality of the interpretation method the RMS error ranges from 3.33% to 16.56 %.

         Generally in northern and southern sides, 10 different curves of alluvium nature occur i.e. H, Q, A, HA, QH,
HA, KH, AK, HK and KQH. Different curves reflect the heterogeneous nature of the study area. In the northern
alluvial formation three layers curves of H, Q and A types and four layers of QH, HA, KH, AK, HK types and KQH

CONCULSION
        In qualitative interpretation clearly indicate the heterogenetic of the entire study area. In predominantly H type
and H combination type curve occur in the study area except hard rock terrain. H type curve indicate the good aquifers
in the study area. But H type curve is very less in hard rock terrain. In hard rock area, mostly A type and A
combination type curve occur. This indicates hard rock. K type and K combination type curve indicate aquitard of the
two aquifers. Then last one Q type and Q combination type curve indicate clay or salinity of the subsurface aquifer.
        In quantitive interpretation most of the points have the good aquifer thickness and have good quality of bearing
the water. Northen side of alluvium aquifer thickness maximum 85.88 m VES 90 at Purisai and minimum thickness
41.53 m VES 83 at Govindavadiagaram. Southern side of alluvium aquifer thickness maximum 94.91 m VES 63 at
Bossivakkam and minimum thickness 46.4 m VES 38 at Palayasevarampuram. Hard rock terrain of aquifer thickness
maximum 75.6 m VES 59 at Puthagaram and minimum thickness 44.62 m VES 23 at Thenneri Tank. Sedimentary
formation aquifer thickness maximum 92.7 m VES 11 at Athivakkam and minimum thickness 43.04 m VES 20 at
Sinnivakkam.
         The best layer which acts as the good aquifer of Walajabad block is the H type and H Combination type occur
in the study area except hard rock terrain. H type curve indicate the good aquifer in the study area. The electrical
resistivity data therefore gives reasonably accurate results among other methods that can be used to understand the
subsurface layers and basement configuration in groundwater prospecting.

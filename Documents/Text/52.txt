                                      Continental crust subjected to horizontal contraction in convergent settings
                                 deforms in a variety of styles. In many instances, it is useful to consider the deforming
                                 crustal sections in terms of crystalline basement rocks underlying incipiently unde-
                                 formed sedimentary strata. Three deformation styles are commonly found in such set-
                                 tings. The structural style referred to as thin-skinned tectonics encompasses a stack of
                                 thrust sheets composed of non- or weakly metamorphic sedimentary rocks. The associ-
                                 ated thrust faults usually level off in a mechanically weak décollement horizon along
                                 which a substantial amount of displacement occurs in the course of the formation of the
                                 fold-and-thrust belt. Thrust faults may also cut down into the crystalline basement and
                                 level off a few kilometers beneath the basement-cover interface. The term basement-
                                 involved thin-skinned tectonics is proposed to describe this style of continental contrac-
                                 tion. This style, too, is characterized by stacks of thrust sheets. In many cases however,
                                 such nappe stacks are overprinted by pervasive folding of a crust thermally weakened
                                 by magmatic activity or regional burial metamorphism. Thick-skinned tectonics seems
                                 less common. This style implies that thrust faults cut across the entire upper crust (and
                                 possibly the lower crust). The associated continental contraction is smaller, and the ensu-
                                 ing deformation is characterized by warping of the basement-cover interface.
                                      Displacements accumulated in a major basal detachment horizon may connect
                                 into mantle by means of a subduction zone. However, under elevated temperatures,
                                 pervasive deformation of the hanging wall and footwall rocks may compensate large
                                 displacements over relatively short distances.
                                      Thin-skinned fold-and-thrust belts are common on both sides of collisional oro-

         talline basement of the margin of the North American craton is involved in thrusting that is overprinted by some mild folding. In contrast, pervasive

              The overlying Drusberg nappe consists of essentially                                   for the upwarp of the Axen thrust and the nature of the plunging

         Figure 10. Geological profile across the Helvetic nappes of the Swiss Alps adapted and extended from Menkveld (1995). The Axen thrust is the basal
         thrust of the Helvetic nappes and puts allochthonous Mesozoic-Cenozoic sediments onto the Mesozoic-Cenozoic cover of the Aar massif. The Drus-
         berg thrust separates the Helvetic nappes into two stockwerks. The lower unit consists essentially of Jurassic cover rocks that are isoclinally folded
         into recumbent and even plunging anticlines. The upper unit is made up of Cretaceous-Cenozoic strata that are detached from their Jurassic strata
         along the Drusberg thrust. This thrust follows a thick lowermost Cretaceous marl unit. Internal shortening of this upper unit is by imbricate thrust-
         ing, which also affects the basal thrusts of the overlying South-Helvetic and Penninic nappes. In the footwall of the Helvetic nappes, the Subalpine

         Figure 17. Geological profile across the Omineca Belt of the North American Cordillera in southern British Columbia and Alberta (Canada), adapted
         from Price and Fermor (1985), Brown et al. (1986), and Gibson et al. (2005). Imbricate thrusting affects the western margin of the North American
         craton. The basal detachment climbs from the lower crust eastward to the base of the Windermere metasediments and then to the base of the Cam-
         brian sediments. Thrusting is NE directed. Pervasive ductile folding deforms the basal thrust of the Quesnel terrane and early formed thrust sheets
         in the Purcell Anticlinorium and the Porcupine Creek Fan Structure.

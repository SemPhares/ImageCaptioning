                  ABSTRACT
                  The integration of core sedimentology, seismic stratigraphy and seismic geo-
                  morphology has enabled interpretation of delta-scale (i.e. tens of metres high)
                  subaqueous clinoforms in the upper Jurassic Sognefjord Formation of the
                  Troll Field. Mud-prone subaqueous deltas characterized by a compound
                  clinoform morphology and sandy delta-scale subaqueous clinoforms are com-
                  mon in recent tide-influenced, wave-influenced and current-influenced set-
                  tings, but ancient examples are virtually unknown. The data presented help
                  to fully comprehend the criteria for the recognition of other ancient delta-
                  scale subaqueous clinoforms, as well as refining the depositional model of the
                  reservoir in the super-giant Troll hydrocarbon field. Two 10 to 60 m thick,
                  overall coarsening-upward packages are distinguished in the lower Sognefjord
                  Formation. Progressively higher energy, wave-dominated or current-domi-
                  nated facies occur from the base to the top of each package. Each package cor-
                  responds to a set of seismically resolved, westerly dipping clinoforms, the
                  bounding surfaces of which form the seismic ‘envelope’ of a clinoform set and
                  the major marine flooding surfaces recognized in cores. The packages thicken
                  westwards, until they reach a maximum where the clinoform ‘envelope’ rolls
                  over to define a topset–foreset–toeset geometry. All clinoforms are consis-
                  tently oriented sub-parallel to the edge of the Horda Platform (N005–N030). In
                  the eastern half of the field, individual foresets are relatively gently dipping
                  (1° to 6°) and bound thin (10 to 30 m) clinothems. Core data indicate that
                  these proximal clinothems are dominated by fine-grained, hummocky cross-
                  stratified sandstones. Towards the west, clinoforms gradually become steeper
                  (5° to 14°) and bound thicker (15 to 60 m) clinothems that comprise medium-
                  grained, cross-bedded sandstones. Topsets are consistently well-developed,
                  except in the westernmost area. No seismic or sedimentological evidence of
                  subaerial exposure is observed. Deposition created fully subaqueous, near-lin-
                  ear clinoforms that prograded westwards across the Horda Platform. Subaque-
                  ous clinoforms were probably fed by a river outlet in the north-east and
                  sculpted by the action of currents sub-parallel to the clinoform strike.

Fig. 4. Synthetic seismograms tying stratigraphic successions and seismic reflections for (A) well 31/2-10, and (B)
well 31/6-5 (Fig. 3B). Regional maximum flooding surfaces (labelled J46, J52, J54 and J56 MFS) correspond to con-
tinuous negative (blue) reflections, which envelop sand-rich packages generally corresponding to positive (red)
reflection events. Sandstone-rich bedsets in the lower Sognefjord Formation of well 31/2-10 are labelled ‘A’ to ‘G’,
to facilitate a direct correlation between the stratigraphic succession and its seismic expression (cf. Figs 5 and 6).
Vertical seismic resolution for the studied strata is 7 to 16 ms TWT, which equates to 7 to 26 m. These synthetic
seismograms were produced by combining density and acoustic wireline logs of each well (Petrel algorithms).

Fig. 6. (A) South-east/north-west trending well correlation panel through the Sognefjord Formation in the Troll
Field (Figs 3B and 14A). A gamma ray curve is shown for each well, with approximately medium-grained sand-
stones and coarser grained rocks (<70 API) highlighted in orange. ‘Series 2-5’ bounded by regional maximum
flooding surfaces (‘J surfaces’ of Partington et al., 1993) are identified, each corresponding to a set of westerly dip-
ping clinoforms. ‘Series 2’ and ‘Series 3’ are discussed in this paper. The panel is flattened on the J46 maximum
flooding surface, and oriented approximately parallel to the dip of the studied clinoforms (cf. Figs 9 to 11). Sand-
stone-rich, clinoform-bounded bedsets in well 31/2-10 are labelled ‘C’ to ‘G’ (cf. Figs 4, 5C and 6C), and bedsets
in well 31/6-2 are labelled X, Y and Z (cf. Figs 5A and 6D). (B) Mean grain size of bottomset and rollover/topset
of Series 3 clinothems, together with mean grain size and sorting of sandstone-rich deposits (Facies Associations
2 to 5) of ‘Series 3’ along the same well correlation panel as Fig. 6A. Bars about mean values represent the stan-
dard deviation. Grain size and sorting values are derived from hand-lens observation of cores, repeated at 5 cm
intervals. VFS = very fine-grained sand; FS = fine-grained sand; MS = medium-grained sand; CS = coarse-grained
sand; VCS = very coarse-grained sand. (C) and (D) Seismic cross-sections intersecting wells 31/2-10 and 31/6-2,
and oriented sub-parallel to the correlation transect (Figs 3B and 14A). Both cross-sections have been flattened on
the J46 maximum flooding surface. Sandstone-rich, clinoform-bounded bedsets in well 31/2-10 are labelled ‘C’ to
‘G’ (cf. Figs 4, 5 and 6C).

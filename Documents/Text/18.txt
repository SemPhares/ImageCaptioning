                                             The overall region is generally described as two following rift systems extending either along the NW Shelf
                                             of Australia or in the Coral Sea region (Figure 1) (Struckmeyer et al., 1993; Symonds et al., 1984). Jurassic
                                             rifting along the NW Shelf is well-understood regarding structural directions and associated inﬁllings (e.g.,
                                             Chen et al., 2002; Elliott et al., 1996; Heine & Müller, 2005; Stagg et al., 1999). In comparison, the Coral Sea
                                             extension is mostly evidenced from early Cenozoic oceanic crust bounded by large rifted continental pla-
                                             teaus detached from the Australian craton (e.g., Drummond et al., 1979; Ewing, Hawkins, et al., 1970;
                                             Ewing, Houtz, et al., 1970; Gaina et al., 1999; Gardner, 1970; Symonds et al., 1984; Taylor & Falvey, 1977;
                                             Weissel & Watts, 1979). The best explored features lie in shallow waters (e.g., Papuan Basin and Eastern
                                             and Papuan plateaus) (e.g., Home et al., 1990; Jablonski et al., 2006; Botsford et al., 2012; Ott & Mann,
                                             2015) and are often interpreted as a result of the Cretaceous rifting preceding seaﬂoor spreading. Yet
                                             older rifted sequences are also suggested onshore and offshore but their dynamic setting is still under
                                             debate. In particular, it remains uncertain if the NW Shelf and Coral Sea rift systems actually connected
                                             in the past along a large rifted margin now partially shortened and imbricated in the Papuan fold and
                                             thrust belts (e.g., Hill, 1991; Hirst & Price, 1996).

                    Hereafter, we speciﬁcally focus on detailed mapping of extensional features along the northern margin of the
                    Coral Sea Basin to better understand the initiation and propagation of the extension through the Australian
                    craton and how rift systems may interact over time. We present a comprehensive analysis of geological and
                    geophysical datasets, comprising original industrial 2D seismic data correlated to local wells together with
                    magnetic and gravimetric observations. We argue that the Coral Sea region underwent at least three over-
                    printed extensional episodes prior to Mid-Cenozoic basement-involved shortening, controlling the formation
                    and reactivation of fault systems over time.

                    2. Geological Setting
                    Papuan present-day deformation is generally viewed as a result of the 70-Myr-long, oblique and rapid con-
                    vergence between the Australian and Paciﬁc plates (Gaina & Müller, 2007; Tregoning et al., 1998; Wallace
                    et al., 2014). This resulted in the accretion of lithospheric terranes (Audley-Charles, 1991; Cloos et al., 2005;
                    Crowhurst et al., 1996; Dewey & Bird, 1970; Hamilton, 1979; Hill & Hall, 2002; Pigram & Davies, 1987;
                    Quarles van Ufford & Cloos, 2005) interspaced by the formation of oceanic basins (e.g., Coral and Tasman
                    seas) and sometimes backarc or propagator basins (e.g., Solomon and Bismarck seas or Woodlark Basin)
                    (Figure 2) (e.g., Gaina & Müller, 2007; Gaina et al., 1998, 1999; Hayes & Ringis, 1973; Joshima et al., 1987;
                    Martinez et al., 1999; Taylor, 1979; Taylor et al., 1999). These involve Proterozoic to Cenozoic crustal provinces
                    separated by major fault zones reactivated over time.
                    In the Coral Sea region, in particular, crustal elements and faults have been involved in a number of rift events
                    that are mostly recognized in the Papuan Basin (Hill & Hall, 2002; Home et al., 1990; Jablonski et al., 2006) but
                    remain uncertain farther east due to compression and thick sediments. It implies discrepancies regarding the
                    regional signiﬁcance of these events.
                    2.1. Prerift Basement Geology
                    The Coral Sea region has recorded a long-lasting evolution from the Precambrian and involved crystalline base-
                    ment structures susceptible of locating subsequent extensional deformation (Figure 2). Basement rocks appear
                    as large plateaus rifted from the Australian craton (Drummond et al., 1979; Mutter, 1977; Symonds et al., 1984;
                    Taylor & Falvey, 1977). Drillings and seismic reﬂection surveys showed that the Queensland and Eastern
                    plateaus are largely composed of Palaeozoic or older crystalline basement overlain by thick Cenozoic
                    sediments. Similar crystalline rocks are indirectly evidenced in the adjacent ridges (e.g., Pandora Ridge) as well
                    as underneath the Papuan and Louisiade plateaus (Jablonski et al., 2006; Rogerson, Hilyard, Francis, et al., 1987).
                    Onshore, Mid-Proterozoic cratonic basement along the Arafura Platform and the Lengguru Fold and Thrust
                    Belt underlie Silurian-Devonian metasediments (Pieters et al., 1983). Eastward (Papuan fold and thrust belts),
                    various undeformed sediments deposited on top of Precambrian plutons and Palaeozoic (Permian or older)
                    metasediments intruded by Early to Middle Triassic granites (Figure 3) (e.g., Crowhurst et al., 1996, 2004;
                    Davies, 2012; Page, 1976; Parris, 1994; Rogerson, Hilyard, Francis, et al., 1987; Rogerson, Hilyard, Finlayson,
                    et al., 1987; Struckmeyer et al., 1993; van Wyck & Williams, 2002). This implies two basement types from east
                    to west, which the boundary may correspond to the northward prolongation of the Tasman Line, a major
                    lithospheric-scale discontinuity underlying the New England Orogen in Australia (Figure 1) (Direen &
                    Crawford, 2003; Schreibner, 1974). Nonetheless, its geographic extent in Papua New Guinea remains dis-
                    cussed (e.g., Hill & Hall, 2002).
                    2.2. The Australian Continental Breakup
                    Following Palaeozoic times, the region encompassed a period of long-lasting extension affecting Pangaea
                    supercontinent (Figure 3). Early synrift sediments (?Permian) are seismically interpreted west of the
                    Pandora Ridge (Jablonski et al., 2006). Wells drilled on the Fly Platform (Well Kanau-1) and in the Australian
                    part of the Papuan Basin (Well Anchor Cay-1) penetrated younger (Triassic) synrift sediments (e.g., Home
                    et al., 1990). Further Mid-Late Triassic formations (e.g., Kana Volcanics and the Jimi Greywacke) are interpreted
                    as part of this synrift setting (Home et al., 1990) or as a result from the Bowen-Fitzroy Orogeny in northeastern
                    Australia (e.g., Jablonski & Saitta, 2004). As a result, this early synrift episode remains poorly
                    constrained spatially.
                    During the Early to Middle Jurassic, northern Australia experienced a more widespread rifting event, result-
                    ing in a transgressive megasequence deﬁned in onshore Papua as the Bol Arkose Formation (Lower Jurassic

                    Jurassic) (Figure 3) (Hill & Hall, 2002; Home et al., 1990; Pigram & Panggabean, 1984). The synrift area is
                    usually described as being limited by a series of anticlines (e.g., Kubor and Muller) to the north and by
                    the Pasca Ridge to the east, although synrift sediments remains accurately untested offshore. There are
                    also issues regarding the opening mechanism (e.g., backarc basin versus aborted continental rift)
                    depending on the continuity of synrift elements (e.g., Hamilton, 1979; Monnier et al., 2000; Pigram &
                    Panggabean, 1981, 1984; Pigram & Symonds, 1991).

                    Both rift events were followed by a passive margin setting (Figure 3). Postrift strata are alternatively picked
                    from the top of the Koi-Iange Member (Middle Jurassic) or from the Barikewa Mudstone Formation and its lat-
                    eral Iagifu or Hedinia sandy equivalents (Middle to Upper Jurassic) (Figure 3) (e.g., Hill & Hall, 2002; Home et al.,
                    1990; Norwick, 2003). Full thermal subsidence is marked by the development of the Imburu Mudstone
                    Formation (Late Callovian to Oxfordian) that seals most of Jurassic extensional features and onlap onto north-
                    ern structural highs until the earliest Cretaceous (Dow, 1977; Home et al., 1990). Postrift strata are likely to
                    have been affected by following Cretaceous extensional and Cenozoic compression events in many places.

                    2.3. The Cretaceous Extension and the Opening of the Coral Sea Basin
                    Many authors argued that the Late Jurassic passive margin setting continued during much of the Neocomian
                    (e.g., Home et al., 1990; Pigram et al., 1989; Struckmeyer et al., 1993) or that this period actually corresponds to
                    a new phase of rifting controlling the deposition of transgressive Toro Sandstone and Lower Ieru Mudstone
                    formations (respectively Neocomian and Upper Cretaceous, Figure 3) (Hill & Hall, 2002; Norwick, 2003).
                    Variations are due to the duration deﬁnition and geometric relation between contemporaneous rifted basins.
                    Also, it is possible that an oceanic basin, now overthrusted in the Owen Stanley Fold and Thrust Belt (i.e.,
                    Papuan Ultramaﬁcs Belt) was separated from a second continental rift setting along an axis linking the
                    Kubor Anticline to the Pasca Ridge (Hill & Hall, 2002; Home et al., 1990).
                    Rifting continued during the Upper Cretaceous along the northeastern margin of Australia (Blight,
                    Queensland, and Townville basins) and in the Coral Sea Basin (Home et al., 1990; Struckmeyer & Symonds,
                    1997; Norwick, 2003), while most of the southern margin along the Papuan Basin and eastern Australia
                    was uplifting at the time (e.g., Francis, 1990; Gurnis et al., 2000; Pigram & Symonds, 1993) This resulted in
                    the deposition of marine mudstones (e.g., Chim and Upper Ieru mudstone formations) and localized sand-
                    stones (Figure 3) prior Palaeocene-Eocene seaﬂoor spreading in the deep Coral Sea Basin (Gaina et al.,
                    1999; Weissel & Watts, 1979). Here again, the duration and extensional mechanisms have been debated as
                    their deﬁnition depends on the interconnexion of rift episodes (e.g., Home et al., 1990; Norwick, 2003). In
                    addition, large parts of these rifted basins are assumed to have been shortened or completely subducted dur-
                    ing the Cenozoic compression (e.g., Hill & Hall, 2002; Matthews et al., 2015; Schellart & Spakman, 2015), imply-
                    ing drastic variation regarding the extent of the Coral Sea extension.


                    3. Data Analysis and Rifting Architecture of the Coral Sea
                    As described in the above, the Coral Sea region experienced a long-lasting and polyphased extensional
                    evolution. To date, only ﬁrst-scale rift-related morphostructures, (e.g., plateaus and large basins) are geo-
                    graphically deﬁned (Figure 2). In addition, the lack of regional seismic and well datasets implies a strong

                    occasional wells and ﬁltered regional Bouguer gravity anomalies, were correlated along the northern Coral
                    Sea margin to link the well-documented Papuan Basin to eastern, poorly-explored features. Herein, wells
                    Dibiri-1A and Pasca C1 (Phillips Australian Oil Company, 1968, 1969, 1975a, 1975b) are selected from clas-
                    sical reference wells and are compared to adjacent boreholes Kanau 1 and Anchor Cay 1 (PNG Petroleum,
                    1975; Tenneco, 1969), to better constrain regional sequences and surfaces (Figures 4 and 5). In the area,
                    only Well Dibiri-1A tested pre-Cenozoic strata so that the synrift succession dating mostly relies on strati-
                    graphic relationships with onshore geology or on classic seismic stratigraphic methods (sensu Mitchum
                    et al., 1977).

                    3.1. Well and Seismic Correlations of the Synrift Section in the Kutubu Basin
                    The best preserved synrift succession is observed into the onshore part of the Papuan Basin where an almost
                    continuous Triassic to Lower Cretaceous section is unconformably overlain by Late Cretaceous sediments
                    (Well Kanau-1; Figure 4). Offshore wells recovered unequal Triassic and Jurassic sediments, and Cretaceous
                    sediments remain absent. In the study area, Well Pasca-C1 bottomed an approximately 50m-thick, poorly
                    metamorphosed quartzite dated in well reports as Upper Palaeozoic age. It is topped by an erosional uncon-
                    formity, undersigned by the absence of Triassic and Lower Jurassic sediments in wells Dibiri-1A and Pasca-C1
                    or by very coarse sandstones and conglomerates and local pyroclastics of Triassic age in adjacent wells
                    Kanau-1 and Anchor Cay-1. Overlying sequences show transgressive Lower Jurassic sandstones, followed
                    by more widespread Middle Jurassic sandstones, siltstones, and mudstones. Although the age cannot be

                                            determined accurately due to poor biostratigraphic information, we follow various unpublished studies from
                                            oil companies that correlate the top marine sequence with Callovian sediments recovered in adjacent wells
                                            Kanau-1 and Anchor-Cay-1. Subsequent sequence (Upper Jurassic) contains ﬁne clastics and rare
                                            carbonates witnessing of progressive terrestrial to open marine conditions, which is likely to have
                                            prolonged during the Lower Cretaceous in the west. Subsequent sediments deposited in a terrestrial to
                                            shallow marine setting during the Cenomanian, whose section remains on the offshore (Well Kanau-1). This
                                            supposes a regional unconformity, which capped the Mesozoic section in all offshore wells (e.g., Brown
                                            et al., 1980; Home et al., 1990). The surface is overlain by Eocene-Miocene carbonate correlative reefs that
                                            preceded the deposition of thick silicastic carbonates related to the construction of the Pliocene to Recent
                                            shelf (e.g., Francis et al., 2008; Tcherepanov et al., 2008).
                                            Therefore, there is a speciﬁc stratigraphic distribution that is likely to reveal the complex, extensional and
                                            compressional evolution on the region. This polyphased development is mainly characterized by speciﬁc
                                            ﬁrst-order unconformities or disconformities, which are used together with internal seismic characteristics
                                            to map the various sequences through the seismic volume. Due to data density, the Kutubu Trough region
                                            is speciﬁcally chosen hereafter to illustrate the regional rifting architecture (Figure 5).
                                            Basal strata form a chaotic seismic package interspaced with local, discontinuous beddings that continue
                                            eastward with truncated metasediments on top of the Pasca Ridge (Well Pasca-C1, Figure 4). They are inter-
                                            preted as a part of the Palaeozoic basement that has been rifted afterward (e.g., Bain et al., 1975; Jablonski
                                            et al., 2006).

                    Prerift metasediments are bounded by a strong-amplitude reﬂector covered by a series of continuous, lower
                    amplitude beds that delineate a megasequence (referred as Formation I, purple in Figure 5). It slightly thick-
                    ens westward (i.e., poor tilt) and is limited by the Pasca Ridge eastward. Internally, it is affected by normal
                    faults that did not propagate in overlying sediments. Therefore, Formation I is interpreted as resulting from
                    an early synrift setting (called hereafter R1). This implies that the base of the sequence corresponds to an
                    unconformity referred as Base Rift1 Unconformity (later shorten as BR1, Figures 4 and 5). Home et al. (1990)
                    described a similar pattern within Triassic sediments in the vicinity of Well Anchor Cay-1, and Hill and Hall
                    (2002) suggested a Triassic synrift event from onshore observations. We therefore propose to remain herein
                    with an undifferentiated Triassic age for Formation I.
                    It is overlain by two main sequences that form a regional megasequence called herein Formation II (blue in
                    Figures 4 and 5). They thin progressively toward the Pasca Ridge and are better observed in adjacent
                    Pandora Trough. Both sequences are affected by a number of normal faults that express either internally
                    or progressed through overlying strata. Therefore, Formation II suggests a second synrift setting (called here-
                    after as R2) dated of Middle to Upper Jurassic age. It is limited by two truncational unconformities of different
                    meanings. For instance, the bottom one called Base Rift2 Unconformity (later shorten as BR2, Figures 4 and 5)
                    marks the onset of the rifting R1, while the top surface correlates to the Jurassic-Cenozoic transition in Well
                    Dibiri-1A and therefore marks a Cenozoic event.
                    To the east, a package with clear growth faulting and different seismic facies is intercalated between Jurassic
                    and Cenozoic strata (green in Figure 5). This rift style difference implies a third rifting phase, called R3. The
                    base of related Formation III is marked by a tenuous unconformity (Base Rift3 Unconformity, later shorten
                    as BR3). Sediments are correlated with the Upper Cretaceous sediments identiﬁed in the onshore Papuan
                    Basin (Figure 4).
                    There is therefore a speciﬁc stratigraphic distribution in the Kutubu Trough that reveals the polyphased
                    extensional history (Triassic to Upper Cretaceous). It appears, in particular, that the rift megasequences are
                    bounded by speciﬁc synrift unconformities (called BR1 to BR3) that all relate to the three subsequent rifting
                    events (R1 to R3) (Figures 4 and 5). These synrift unconformities speciﬁcally show that the rifting evolution
                    was discontinuous through time in the Kutubu Basin.


                    3.2. Structural Expression of the Rifting Along the Northern Margin of the Coral Sea
                    Table 1 displays the seismic characteristics of the three different rift formations I to III in the Kutubu and adja-
                    cent basins to constrain the strata distribution and the bounding unconformities along the northern Coral Sea
                    margin (Figure 6). The ﬁrst sediments are bounded by reactivated extensional faults in the Moresby Basin and
                    unconformably overlie basement rocks along a regional unconformity (BR1). Strata are usually poorly tilted
                    and subtlety thicken toward the East Pandora Ridge or progressively thin eastward to ﬁnally disappear in
                    the other basins. Internal seismic facies are similar to Formation I identiﬁed in the Kutubu Basin (Table 1),
                    so that deposition was likely controlled by the R1 event. Similar strata may exist in other places but are traced
                    with less conﬁdence, implying that the BR1 Unconformity cannot be mapped accurately at a regional scale.
                    A much clearer rift setting, analyzed as the R2 event, extends beyond the Triassic rifted basins with many normal
                    faults that are typically separated by 2-to-5km and along which tilting is important (Figure 6 and Table 1).
                    Internally, the rift-related Formation II is composed of several onlapping units, each bounded by the BR2
                    Unconformity at the base and several other angular unconformities in the above. Although growth faulting
                    clearly occurs, it does not necessarily represent a common characteristic to all internal sediments, implying dif-
                    ferential thickening throughout. This likely implies timing variation between extension and sedimentation within
                    a progressively deepening, continental to marine environment. Thus, the distribution of Formation II is unequal
                    between the various basins, and herein, we assign a Lower to Upper Jurassic age for most depocenters. Yet some
                    bounding faults may have been active until the lowermost Cretaceous, resulting in thin, localized deposits.
                    Other fault reactivation occurred along the most major Jurassic faults either without large rotation (e.g.,
                    Moresby Basin) or, most likely, along newly formed faults that clearly controlled the fault-blocks gradient
                    (Figure 6). The tilt, generally high in basins in prolongation of the continent-ocean transition, is used to dis-
                    criminate Early from Late Cretaceous rifted depocenters. Thus, Formation III is generally contained into small-
                    rifted basins south of the study area. It corresponds to coarse to ﬁne clastics that likely link to onshore Upper

                                          marked by a lesser density of faults.
                                          Similar polyphased extensional settings are observed on deep lines across the region (Figure 7). The R1 event
                                          appears absent in most of the eastern basins. Comparatively, the extension maximum occurs during the sec-
                                          ond rifting phase (R2) along major regional and counterregional, listric faults limiting crustal boudins.
                                          Extension likely propagated in basins north of the Eastern Plateau during the Lower Cretaceous without
                                          strong consequences on the tilting of sediments. Finally, subsequent Cretaceous faulting (R3) rejuvenated
                                          locally some of the main bounding faults in the southwest of the Eastern Plateau, resulting in strong basin
                                          tilt. In this polyphased extension, continental plateaus and ridges show coeval uplift episodes.

                                          The seismic interpretation enabled the construction of a structural map of the rift setting at the level of the
                                          BR2 unconformity (i.e., Lower to Middle Jurassic; Figure 8), to which the ﬁltered Bouguer anomalies are super-
                                          imposed in order to better constrain the general basin trends. Three main faults are distinguished according
                                          to their orientations and ages. The ﬁrst direction occurs along a N-S to N10 trend and corresponds to the
                                          overall direction of the Pasca, Pandora and East Pandora ridges. It controls Triassic depocenters and is

                                          therefore attributed to the R1 rifting event. The second direction extends around N160 and corresponds to
                                          the general orientation of the western Eastern and Aure fold belts. It formed during the R2 rifting event
                                          and was slightly reactivated during the Cretaceous. The third structural trend corresponds to a N100 to
                                          N110 direction, which is the general orientation of the continent-ocean transition the Coral Sea. This R3
                                          faulting is much more prominent in the distal part of the margin.
                                          Therefore, the overall geometry of the northern Coral Sea margin results from three groups of faults. These
                                          express both the timing and the location of extension. In other words, three rifting episodes overlap in the
                                          region and they all seem to have a speciﬁc expression resulting from the fault timing and orientation.


                                          4. Synrift to Postrift Transition and Oceanic Spreading of the Coral Sea
                                          Seismic interpretation has shown that the geometry of the three rifting events R1 to R3 is different, namely in
                                          terms of basinal rotation. This is likely to reﬂect the position along a margin and, in particular, to the
                                          continent-ocean transition. The characterization of the synrift to postrift transition is never an easy matter
                                          in polyphased rift basins, namely because extension is not necessarily followed by a clear breakup unconfor-
                                          mity but rather by a set of unconformities and sometimes extensional faulting (Bulois, 2016). Herein, we use
                                          detailed seismic lines to better identify the rifting event(s) responsible of the Coral Sea Basin sensu stricto,
                                          within this overlapping rifting framework.
                                          To do so, we have investigated the deep oceanic domain using seismic, gravimetric and magnetic data. In
                                          particular, the easternmost seismic line of our database imaged the oceanic crust that is well dated from
                                          IODP drillings and magnetic anomalies (Figure 9) (e.g., Gaina et al., 1999; Weissel & Watts, 1979). These
                                          anomalies were used in turn to date sediments above and underneath the breakup unconformity. We also

                                         by Gaina et al. (1999) to better detail the ocean-continent transition and the associated structural trends.

                                         4.1. Seismic Deﬁnition of Synrift and Postrift Packages in the Deep Coral Sea Basin
                                         Figure 9 displays the geometry of rifted basins across the southern Papuan Peninsula to the oceanic crust and
                                         enables to better deﬁne the breakup unconformity and, in turn, of synrift sediments. To do so, we have
                                         derived the age of postrift sediments from the location of magnetic anomalies Chron26 and Chron25, both
                                         of Thanetian age (~58.5 and 56.5 Myr, respectively) (Figure 9a), while anomaly Chron 24 (~53.4 Myr, Ypresian)
                                         occurs much farther south. Therefore, the age of the postrift sediments is in between Thanetian and Ypresian.
                                         This is in accordance with the ﬁrst Cenozoic sediments (Eocene) recovered in Well Dibiri-1A (Figure 4).

                                         tic sediment contained with strongly tilted fault-blocks (Figure 9a). Such a geometry implies that these rifted
                                         sediments are therefore of Late Cretaceous age and represent the synrift setting responsible of the Coral Sea
                                         opening. We therefore correlate them to Formation III. Internal seismic patterns (Table 1) imply a deepening
                                         marine synrift deposition with sourced sediments derived from the nearby Papuan Plateau.

                                           In this region, fault-blocks show growth along reactivated Jurassic counterregional faults (Figure 9b), which
                                           are different (but not incompatible) with previously proposed basinward dipping faults in the region (Ott &
                                           Mann, 2015). This geometry differs from the other poorly-tilted Cretaceous fault-blocks observed westward
                                           (Figure 7). Therefore, we suspect two different rift systems that spatially overlap in this region.


                                           4.2. Events Associated With the Synrift to Postrift Transition in the Deep Coral Sea Basin
                                           The transition of synrift Late Cretaceous sediments with overlying Palaeocene to Oligocene sediments
                                           (breakup unconformity) is dated at 61.8 Myr from magnetic anomalies (Figure 10). Nonetheless, it is possi-
                                           ble that the ﬁrst postrift sequences deposited late after the ﬁrst seaﬂoor spreading event. Additional

                    localized normal faults within these postbreakup packages seem also associated with unconformities
                    or disconformities.
                    The top of the thickening sequences is characterized by a strong amplitude reﬂector that can be mapped
                    landward from a series of more or less well-pronounced onlapping reﬂectors and is correlatable to the
                    Eocene-Miocene unconformity observed in Well Dibiri 1A (Figure 4). It appears therefore likely that the ﬁrst
                    postrift sediments (i.e., post-Ypresian) corresponds to a transitional stage and that the “true” postrift succes-
                    sion actually occurred from the Miocene onward.
                    The age of this unconformity conﬁrms the analysis of Ott and Mann (2015) who considered a ﬁrst postrift sub-
                    sidence setting during the Eocene, followed by a second deepening phase during the Oligocene to early
                    Miocene. Burns et al. (1973) also proposed a clear postrift deepening of the Coral Sea during the early
                    Middle Miocene, based on ODP 210 cores that tested deep-sea clays overlying unconformably ﬁne-grained
                    silicastics and shales. Their set of unconformities implies that postrift deepening was not continuous. This
                    may be due to sea level ﬂuctuations or fault reactivation during the transitional setting, possibly associated
                    with plate reorganization.

                    4.3. Delimitation and Trends of the Oceanic Crust
                    Magnetic data from the EMAG2 mosaic show a strong character contrast between the oceanic crust (smooth
                    and regular) and continental plateaus (rough) (Figure 10a). The boundary between both crustal domains is
                    marked by two strong anomalies of more or less symmetrical but anticorrelative values. Correlation with seis-
                    mic lines (Figure 9) shows that the northern anomaly corresponds to a structural high composed of basement
                    rocks at the shoulder of the Upper Cretaceous rift system. Thus, both anomalies delineate the Papuan and
                    Queensland plateaus of continental nature. The continent-ocean transition is also conﬁrmed by gravity data
                    from roughness variations (Figure 10b).
                    In the oceanic domain, magnetic data show a N110 fabric that runs parallel to the oceanic ridge system. It
                    is offset by a series of structures which the direction markedly varies from N45 to the east (anomalies 27 to
                    25) to a N10 orientation to the west (absence of anomaly 27) (Figure 10a). Such a variation is more poorly
                    constrained on gravity data (Figure 10b). This variation may correspond to a change in the spreading
                    propagation around the Ypresian (anomaly 24) controlled by the onset of the regional compression
                    (Bulois, 2016).
                    The accurate mapping of the continent-ocean transition enables to show that the strongest fault-block rota-
                    tion is located along an area of about 100 km wide and 250 km long. This follows the strong anomaly marking
                    the zone of hyperstretched continental crust that led to the Coral Sea Basin seaﬂoor spreading (Figure 8). In
                    that context, the Papuan Plateau somehow acts as a buttress for the propagation of the Coral Sea toward
                    the north.


                    5. Discussion
                    5.1. Integration of the Coral Sea Rift Megasequences With Regional Geology
                    Our seismic analysis has shown three distinct extensional phases in the Coral Sea region. They are all respon-
                    sible of speciﬁc regional rift-related megasequences deposition (referenced as Formation I to Formation III).
                    However, their signiﬁcance may differ from previous regional interpretations. For instance, Ott and Mann
                    (2015) did not analyze Jurassic sediments in the study area and synrift sediments were only related to the
                    Late Cretaceous-Palaeocene extensional event of the Coral Sea. In contrast, Swift (2012) underestimated
                    postrift sedimentary thickness, resulting in thick synrift sequences deposited in overlapping poorly dated rift
                    basins. These geometry and age differences most likely result from the data coverage and resolution; also, we
                    correlate herein offshore and onshore stratigraphic information to better delimitate the spatial extent of
                    these three identiﬁed extensional settings R1, R2, and R3 at the scale of the northern Australian margin
                    (Figure 11).
                    The Triassic rift setting R1 is limited eastward to the Gulf of Papua in the Coral Sea (Formation I, Figure 11).
                    Unconformities (BR1 in the Kutubu Basin) and correlative disconformities in other places (Figure 5) bound var-
                    ious correlatable clastic sequences (e.g., Jimi Formation in the Aure Fold Belt, Bain et al., 1975; Home et al.,
                    1990, Tipuma Formation in the Lengguru and Central Papuan fold and thrust belts, Fraser et al., 1993;

the overall sedimentary intervals encountered in various key basins displayed in Figure 12. Note the presence of the three rift episodes R1 to R3 and their relative
postrift settings (P) which together undersign extensional megacycles interspaced by periods of basin inversion or tectonic quiescence. The timing of the
margin rifting is similar on the NW Shelf and Papuan New Guinea from the Late Permian to the Cretaceous and one can assume that there was a connexion between
the basins nowadays jammed in the Papuan fold and thrust belts. Stratigraphic information are summarized from many sources among which (1) Geoscience

                                          Munson, 2013a, 2013b). These are grouped into a regional synrift megasequence, called Megasequence
                                          EM1, which the deﬁnition is broadly equivalent to the Gondwana Synrift Megasequence A of Home et al.

                                          nesses of an early stage of graben formation throughout the region.
                                          Subsequent rifting episode R2 affected the entire northern Australian margin during the Jurassic and con-
                                          trolled the deposition of Megasequence EM2 (Figure 11). The rifting onset is characterized by a regional basal
                                          unconformity (BR2). It is situated at similar stratigraphic level of surfaces in Australia that were previously
                                          interpreted as the result of the Bowen-Fitzroy Orogeny in Australia (Jablonski & Saitta, 2004; Norwick,
                                          2003) or of signiﬁcant coeval volcanism (Pieters et al., 1983; Pigram & Panggabean, 1984). However, evi-
                                          dence of Triassic compression and volcanics are unclear in the Papuan region and extension may actually
                                          correspond to a backarc system. Subsequent sediments deposited in rifted basins observed all over the mar-
                                          gin despite Cenozoic compression. For instance, the Plover Formation deposited from the earliest Lower
                                          Jurassic along the North West Shelf (Gunn, 1988; Pattillo & Nicholls, 1990; O’Brien et al., 1993; Baillie et al.,

                    1994; Struckmeyer et al., 1998; Tovaglieri & George, 2014) and extends in West Papua into the squeezed
                    Lower to Middle Jurassic basins containing the Lower Kopai, Bol Arkose and Magobu coarse clastic
                    formations (Bailly et al., 2009; Bain et al., 1975; Pigram et al., 1982). These are correlatable to Formation II
                    in the Coral Sea Basin, and we interpret them farther east with the lowermost part of the marine protolith
                    of the Owen Stanley Metamorphics (individualized herein as the Lower Owen Stanley Formation and now
                    thrusted under the Jurassic Papuan Ultramaﬁcs, Glaessner, 1949; Pieters, 1978; Davies, 1980; Davies &
                    Jaques, 1984). Consequently, the Papuan Ultramaﬁcs and the subsequent Middle Owen Stanley
                    Metamorphics mark the onset of regional postrift conditions in the study area. These are characterized
                    anywhere else by thick mudstone deposits (e.g., Imburu, Barikewa, Flamingo, Frigate) and localized
                    sandstone intervals (e.g., Koi-Iange, Hedinia-Iagifu, Elang) (Figure 11). Corresponding Megasequence EM3 is
                    therefore broadly equivalent to the Gondwana Synrift Megasequence B of Home et al. (1990).

                    The ﬁnal rifting event R3, restricted to the eastern part of the study area, controlled the deposition of a third
                    megasequence (Megasequence EM3) on top of an erosional surface (BR3) (Figure 11). It is marked at the base
                    by typical lowermost Cretaceous sandstones and mudstones, known onshore as the Woniwogi-Piniya and the
                    Toro-Ieru intervals (Granath & Hermeston, 1993; Hirst & Price, 1996; Pieters et al., 1983; Pigram et al., 1982).
                    These are stratigraphically correlative to Formation III in the Coral Sea Basin (indirectly dated from magnetic
                    picks, Figure 8) and to the Upper Owen Stanley Formation (dated as Middle to Upper Cretaceousby Glaessner,
                    1949). Coeval rifted sediments are also reported in the Queensland and Townville basins (e.g., Struckmeyer
                    et al., 1994; Symonds & Davies, 1988; Symonds et al., 1984). Megasequence EM3 is broadly similar to the
                    Coral Sea Syn-Rift Megasequence of Home et al. (1990), although lateral extent and dating differ in between
                    the two interpretations.
                    It therefore appears that there is a vertical stack of extensional megacycles marked by characteristic exten-
                    sional megasequences (EM1 to EM3) of speciﬁc temporal and geographical deﬁnitions (Figure 11). Each
                    extensional megasequence is typically composed of synrift ﬁning-upward rifted clastics bounded by uncon-
                    formities (“R” nomenclature) and terminate by deep marine, postrift facies that are sometimes associated
                    with seaﬂoor spreading (“P” nomenclature). Unconformities may switch from postrift to synrift natures in
                    such a context of overlapping extension, implying a strong control on strata preservation throughout.

                    5.2. Extension and Fault Reactivation in the Coral Sea Region
                    The overtime repetition of the three extensional megacycles, R1, R2 and R3, implies fault reactivation within
                    the basement or from previously formed rift systems. Herein, we propose a simple stretching model of the
                    northern Australian margin in which preexisting continental structures have a decreasing inﬂuence
                    through time.
                    5.2.1. Old Structural Trends and Early Development of Rift Basins (Triassic)
                    According to our seismic interpretation, Triassic sediments are most likely conﬁned to poorly tilted graben
                    systems containing coarse clastics. These basins mark the eastern boundary of an early rift system that pro-
                    pagated through the NW Shelf and West Papua and stopped in eastern Papua New Guinea along the align-
                    ment composed of the Kubor Anticline to the north and the Pasca-Pandora-East Pandora to the south
                    (Figure 12). In the study area, the rifted system formed alongside NS trending Permian granites (e.g., Coen
                    and Georgetown inliers, Peninsula-Daru Ridge) and older terranes belonging to the New England Belt (e.g.,
                    Glen, 2005; Norwick, 2003).
                    This easternmost border roughly aligns along the NS trending Tasman Line that controlled the polyphased
                    tectonics of the Tasmanides Orogen across Australia since the Neoproterozoic (Direen & Crawford, 2003;
                    Powell, 1996; Schreibner, 1974). The prolongation of the New England Orogen from the Queensland
                    Peninsula to Papua is enigmatic as much of deep geophysical data do not enable to trustfully image related
                    structure underneath the overprinted Papuan fold and thrust belts (Hill & Hall, 2002). Herein, we propose that
                    the structure may extend in the Gulf of Papua through the Palaeozoic ridges (i.e., Pasca, Pandora and East
                    Pandora). Another alternative is a series of NNE-SSW transform faults that controlled the rift axis and among
                    which the Bosavi Lineament is probably the most characteristic feature (Figure 12) (e.g., Davies, 1990, 1991;
                    Smith, 1990; Hill et al., 2004, 2010; White et al., 2014). These are associated with characteristic Neogene, ada-
                    kitic volcanoes and older mantle-derived intrusives. Therefore, these crustal structures are likely to mark a
                    change in the strength of the lithosphere behavior, inferring a strong basement inﬂuence to the west (i.e.,

                                          metasediments intruded by Early to Middle Triassic granites (e.g., Crowhurst et al., 1996; Page, 1976;

                                          while the ridges system represents a limit of unrifted terranes in prolongation of the Tasman Line. The Triassic
                                          extensional megacycle R1 was therefore controlled by basement structures (Figure 13a). However, it is still
                                          remains unclear whether extension initiated from an orogenic collapse or from global tectonic forces

reactivating the southern margin of Owen Stanley Oceanic Basin. Overall, the opening of the Owen Stanley Oceanic Basin is thought to take place along the northern
Australian continent as a response of Pangaea breakup. This was ﬁrst driven by the Late Palaeozoic geology of the New England Orogen (i.e., Tasmanides thicken
crust) and then deformation progressively migrated oceanward. The Coral Sea Basin is seen as the continuation of the Tasman Sea. Note how it stopped when
abutting the transversal Triassic rift system. Details of the basin shapes may be found in Norwick (2003). Abbreviations: CSB: Coral Sea Basin, EPP: Eastern/Papuan

                                         pulling the Australian and Gondwana continental masses apart. Yet the presence of conglomerates and very
                                         coarse clastics (Figure 4) suggests the development of molassic basins at the time.
                                         5.2.2. Full Basin Development During Overprinted Extension (Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous)
                                         The Lower to Middle Jurassic rift system R2, recognized over much of the northern Australian margin
                                         (Figure 11), has controlled highly subsiding grabens by reactivating Triassic faults west of the Pasca-
                                         Pandora ridges and forming new basins in the Coral Sea (Figures 5 and 7). It resulted in crustal boudins
                                         along what we interpret as the southern margin of an oceanic basin now overthrusted in the Papuan fold
                                         and thrust belts (Figure 12). The so-called Owen Stanley Oceanic Basin contained distal marine sediments
                                         (Lower and Middle Owen Stanley Metamorphics) associated with the ophiolite of the Papuan Ultramaﬁc
                                         Formation (Figure 11). This hypothesis is consistent with dating realized on the gabbroic zone and basalts
                                         of the ophiolite (respectively, 147–150 Ma and 116 Ma) (Lus et al., 2004). The age of sediments, although
                                         more debatable due to Cenozoic barrovian metamorphism (Dow et al., 1988; Pieters, 1978), is necessarily
                                         slightly older than the ophiolite emplacement dated at 66–56 Ma from granulites hornblendes at the sole
                                         (Lus et al., 2004). Various other authors proposed a Lower to Middle Cretaceous age for the Owen Stanley
                                         units protolith and for the Papuan Ultramaﬁcs before emplacement (Webb et al., 2014; Zirakparvar et al.,
                                         2012), which is consistent with our hypothesis. In our model, this implies that the Jurassic rifted strata and
                                         their overlying Cretaceous sediments deposited into the Owen Stanley Oceanic Basin rather than the
                                         Coral Sea, so that much of the Coral Sea actually remains intact from subsequent Cenozoic compression.
                                         The presence of a large basin north of the Coral Sea has been earlier proposed by several authors but the geo-
                                         metries and extensional propagation are variable. Hamilton (1979) assumed a Middle Jurassic seaﬂoor
                                         spreading along the entire margin, resulting in a large oceanic basin linking all Papuan ophiolites together.
                                         In contrast, Pigram and Panggabean (1981, 1984) and Pigram and Symonds (1991) suggested diachronous
                                         seaﬂoor spreading with southwestward propagation from the Early Jurassic and a ﬁnal breakup between
                                         Australia and Gondwana at Bajocian times. Other studies proposed the presence of a separated, aborted con-
                                         tinental rift (e.g., Carman, 1990; Home et al., 1990; Boult, 1997; Swift, 2012). Our model considers that the
                                         Owen Stanley Oceanic Basin actually correlates with several other suprasubduction ophiolites and their
                                         related sedimentary covers (e.g., Marum Ophiolite and April Ultramaﬁcs) (Davies & Hutchison, 1982; Davies
                                         & Jaques, 1984; Jaques, 1981). This is conﬁrmed by geochemical analysis showing a similar suprasubduction
                                         context for most Papuan ophiolites (e.g., Monnier et al., 2000; Pubellier et al., 2004; Worthing & Crawford,
                                         1996). Although some ages may appear controversial due to Cenozoic tectonism (e.g., Hill & Raza, 1999;
                                         Jaques & Robinson, 1977; Jaques et al., 1978; Page, 1976), François et al. (2016) showed that the dating

                    bias corresponds to the ophiolites emplacement rather than a particularly long-lasting spreading. Herein, we
                    propose a southward dipping subduction zone north of Papua (Figure 12), which may connect southwest-
                    ward to the New Caledonian ophiolites (e.g., Cluzel et al., 2001; Matthews et al., 2012; Whattam et al.,
                    2008). To the west (i.e., from the Bird’s Head to the NW Shelf), rifting also took place from the Late Permian
                    to the Cretaceous but does not seem to be directly related to a backarc extension (Bradshaw et al., 1994;
                    Norwick, 2003). Yet the extension could possibly be a response to a northwest subduction beneath the
                    Sunda Plate (subduction of the Ceno-Tethys) (Metcalfe, 1998).
                    Thus, the extensional megacycle R2 marks a further stage in the breakup of Pangaea intimately linked to a
                    backarc setting along the northern Papua margin. The resulting opening of the Owen Stanley Oceanic
                    Basin was facilitated by an already thinned Triassic margin, implying an “in-sequence” Jurassic extension
                    (Figure 13b). Thus, the present-day northern margin of the Coral Sea Basin corresponds to the southern mar-
                    gin of the Owen Stanley Oceanic Basin, so that the various Papuan ophiolites formed ahead of the Coral Sea.
                    5.2.3. Crosscutting Opening of the Coral Sea Basin
                    The ﬁnal rifting stage R3 (Late Cretaceous) formed narrow (>100 km) fault-blocks containing Extensional
                    Megasequence EM3 (Figures 11 and 12). These basins are part of a crosscutting extensional system, younger
                    than the northern Owen Stanley Oceanic Basin, resulting in the Coral Sea seaﬂoor spreading during the
                    Danian-Ypressian period (Chron27 to Chron24) (Figure 10).
                    In our model, we relate the opening of the Coral Sea to the opening of the Tasman Sea between Chron33 and
                    Chron24 (80 and 52 Myr, respectively) (Hayes & Ringis, 1973). The tectonic history of the Tasman Sea cannot
                    be simply described as a rift propagator that cut through the Australian craton but rather as several blocks or
                    microplates stretched apart (e.g., Weissel & Hayes, 1977; Stock & Molnar, 1982) accordingly to the southwest
                    Paciﬁc subduction history (e.g., Collot et al., 2009; Gaina et al., 1998; Seton, Flament et al., 2012; Seton, Müller,
                    et al., 2012). We consider that the transition between both oceanic domains is controlled by a NE-SW trans-
                    form system (Figure 12), visible on gravity data through the Marion and Kenn-Mellish plateaus and which
                    rotated orthogonally the Tasman Sea hyperextension into the already-thinned Coral Sea region. Such
                    assumption broadly conﬁrms the description of a triple junction between the Queensland and Louisiade
                    Plateaus and the Mellish Rise (Gaina et al., 1999) and also explains the apparent rejuvenation of the
                    Eastern and Papuan Plateaus north of the Coral Sea (Figure 7).
                    This model also applies an important role to a series of transverse preexisting structures west of the Coral Sea
                    Basin (e.g., Tasman Line and Pasca-Pandora-East Pandora ridges) that progressively attenuated the extension
                    (Figure 12). This partially conﬁrms Weissel & Watts, 1979 in which the Coral Sea spreading stopped along a
                    sinistral strike-slip system from Chron 26 (58.5 Myr) and did not propagate westward along the Cretaceous
                    rift system. This interruption may be due to a regional change of the plate tectonic setting.
                    Therefore, this late extensional megacycle cut through prior extensional settings (Figure 13b). This out-of-
                    sequence scenario is consistent with the global transform faults orientation and the regional plate dynamics
                    models which show a continuation of the Coral Sea with the Tasman Sea (e.g., Gaina et al., 1998, 2004;
                    Matthews et al., 2012; Seton, Flament, et al., 2012; Weissel & Watts, 1979). Also, the orthogonal pattern
                    between both oceanic domains may be due a dynamic change of the Paciﬁc subduction eastward. At a regio-
                    nal scale, the Coral Sea should be therefore regarded as a propagator in prolongation of the Tasman Sea
                    rather than an oceanic domain that has partially subducted.

                    6. Conclusion
                    The opening of the Coral Sea region shows three discontinuous extensional megacycles which controlled the
                    deposition of speciﬁc megasequences separated by unconformities of local or regional extents. Each exten-
                    sional megacycle is deﬁned spatially and temporarily such as:
                    1. Extensional megacycle R1 (Triassic), developed on the northern edge of the New England Orogen by reac-
                       tivating old structural trends related to the Tasman Line (Figure 13a). Evidence of Triassic sediments is
                       restricted to the west of the study area (ridges) and extends onshore in continuation of the synrift setting
                       along the NW Shelf. Herein, we propose that old orogenic structures locate the propagation of the
                       extension.
                    2. Extensional megacycle R2 (Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous) marks the continuation of a wide rift setting
                       along the northern Australian margin (Figure 13b). It ﬁrst formed on top of the Triassic rifted basins and

                                               then extended in a number of newly formed basins that are likely to connect to Jurassic-Lower
                                               Cretaceous; marine sediments and ophiolites now shorten in the Papuan fold and thrust belts system
                                               to form the so-called Owen Stanley Oceanic Basin. This oceanic domain is thought to connect with other
                                               Papuan ophiolites westward, which evolved in a suprasubduction domain.
                                            3. Extensional megacycle R3 (Upper Cretaceous to lowermost Eocene) is restricted to the northern margin of
                                               the deep Coral Sea and formed EW trending, 100 km narrow-rifted basins that bound the oceanic crust
                                               (Figure 13c). It had a minor impact on preexisting rifted basins (Triassic and Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous),
                                               suggesting a crosscutting extensional system with different boundary forces. Herein, we show that the
                                               Coral Sea Basin is the northward continuation of the Tasman Sea and that the oceanic spreading was con-
                                               trolled by the presence of major crustal discontinuities such as the Tasman Line to the west or transform
                                               fault systems along the southeastern margin of the Coral Sea Basin.
                                            This spatial overlap implies to consider the reactivation of preexisting features that relate to the regional var-
                                            iations in the geodynamical settings and, as a result, to a succession of boundary forces that may evolve with
                                            time (Figure 13). The early extension phase R1, guided by cratonic heterogeneities (basement highs), was, in
                                            turn, reactivated during the second rifting phase R2 to control the crustal boudinage oceanward (i.e., in-
                                            sequence deformation). The late rift setting R3 penetrated the previous rifted areas and stopped along trans-
                                            versal discontinuities (i.e., out-of-sequence deformation). Such an evolution suggests a progressive decrease
                                            of the continental crust inﬂuences that may illustrate the polyphased denudation processes of an old stable
                                            continental mass. These highlight the changing regional geodynamical framework through Geological Times
                                            with continental rifting sensu stricto (i.e., Gondwana breakup) and backarc extension (i.e., Paciﬁc subduction).
                                            Because the extension of the margin is driven by the boundary forces imposed the Paciﬁc subduction, one
                                            may consider that these speciﬁc extensional periods relate in turn directly to the variation of the dynamics
                                            of the subduction.

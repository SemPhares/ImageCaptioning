                 Abstract: Gondwana was an enormous supertarrane. At its peak, it represented a landmass of about
                 100 × 106 km2 in size, corresponding to approximately 64% of all land areas today. Gondwana
                 assembled in the Middle Cambrian, merged with Laurussia to form Pangea in the Carboniferous,
                 and ﬁnally disintegrated with the separation of East and West Gondwana at about 170 Ma, and
                 the separation of Africa and South America around 130 Ma. Here we have updated plate reconstruc-
                 tions from Gondwana history, with a special emphasis on the interactions between the continental
                 crust of Gondwana and the mantle plumes resulting in Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) at its surface.
                 Moreover, we present an overview of the subvolcanic parts of the Gondwana LIPs (Kalkarindji,
                 Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, Karoo and the Paraná–Etendeka) aimed at summarizing our
                 current understanding of timings, scale and impact of these provinces. The Central Atlantic Mag-
                 matic Province (CAMP) reveals a conservative volume estimate of 700 000 km3 of subvolcanic
                 intrusions, emplaced in the Brazilian sedimentary basins (58–66% of the total CAMP sill volume).
                 The detailed evolution and melt-ﬂux estimates for the CAMP and Gondwana-related LIPs are,
                 however, poorly constrained, as they are not yet sufﬁciently explored with high-precision U–Pb
                 geochronology.

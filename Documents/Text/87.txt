(King et al., 1985; Rigo et al., 1996) and onshore observations (Sorel,
2000), are reminiscent of the geometry and kinematics of the Oligo-
Miocene extensional metamorphic domes observed in the Cyclades.
Offshore seismic investigations, although they provide rather detailed
images of the uppermost crustal structure, have also led to opposing
conclusions. For Sachpazi et al. (2003), Pi Alperin et al. (2004) or
Taylor et al. (2003) reﬂections are compatible with the presence of a
shallow north-dipping detachment, while Bell et al. (2008, 2009)
argue instead in favor of a more symmetric extension and the absence
of a detachment, that is not required to explain observed structures.
One of the key-questions is the geometrical relations between the
onshore detachment described by Sorel (2000) and the zone of
microseismicity recorded at depth.
    In this paper, we 1) review available data on the Corinth rift and
provide a balanced, crustal-scale restoration of the rift, 2) explore the
similarities and differences between the Corinth Rift and the Cyclades
in terms of geometry, kinematics and pressure and temperature
conditions, and 3) assess the potential of Aegean metamorphic core
complexes as analogues of the deformation presently at work below
the Corinth Rift.

2. Crustal-scale extension: normal faults versus
post-orogenic detachments

    Extension is commonly accommodated by two kinds of structures:
steeply-dipping normal faults bounding grabens (Jackson and White,
1989) and shallow-dipping detachments below which metamorphic
core complexes were exhumed (see Lister et al., 1984; Gautier and
Brun, 1994a, for the Cyclades); Fig. 2 summarizes this debate for the
Aegean region and the Corinth Rift. The most obvious structures in the
Corinth Rift are the steep active normal faults that shape the
morphology of the southern margin (Armijo et al., 1996). The
distribution of these normal faults is often asymmetrical, one set of
faults being predominant, thus suggesting an asymmetry of defor-
mation at crustal or lithospheric scale (Colletta et al., 1987). Models of
asymmetric extension have been developed in the 80s after the
discovery of shallow-dipping normal faults in the Basin and Range
Province. The debate then became focussed on the degree of
asymmetry, at crustal or lithospheric scale (Wernicke, 1981; Brun
and Choukroune, 1983; Davis, 1983; Coney and Harms, 1984; Lister
et al., 1986; Klemperer, 1988). Seismological studies and deep seismic             Fig. 2. Comparison of two different extreme interpretations of the active Corinth Rift and

Fig. 11. A possible evolution of the Corinth Rift from the pre-rift stage to the present and a speculative future evolution toward a metamorphic core complex. The pre-rift stage shows
a possible structure after the exhumation of the Phyllite–Quartzite HP–LT rocks below a syn-orogenic detachment during the Oligo-Miocene. This ﬁrst stage induces the formation of
a dome and the eastern ﬂank of this dome is reworked as an extensional shear zone during rifting. During the ﬁrst rifting stages (from 3 to 1.5 Ma) the extension is widely distributed
along several normal faults that root on the detachment. The detachment is brittle in the upper crust with a thick zone of cataclasites. It becomes ductile across the brittle–ductile
transition. From 1.5 Ma to 0.6–0.7 Ma the extension tends to localise and faults become progressively extinct toward the north. 0.7 Ma ago, possibly because of an acceleration of
extension, the presently active faults form on the southern shore of the Gulf and they reach deeper portions of the crust, down to the brittle–ductile transition. The northern
Peloponnese, footwall of these faults, is ﬂexed upward. The upper part of the detachment becomes extinct and the large faults root into an active decollement zone above and within
the brittle–ductile transition. Cataclastic deformation above the brittle–ductile transition is manifested by the microseismicity recorded around Aigion. Further east the decollement
is deeper and probably entirely ductile. The future evolution is based upon the assumption that the main normal faults seen today are transient structures and that the decollement
continues its activity until the exhumation of the ductile crust and the formation of a metamorphic core complex similar to those observed in the Cyclades.

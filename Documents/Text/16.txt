confidence level. The resulting structural map is presented in
Figure 3. This map shows the N120E trending normal faults
framing the depocenters and the Central and Western highs
that can be interpreted as the transfer faults of the pull-apart
basin system. The map shows also the active Main Marmara
Fault (MMF: in gray in Figure 3), which transects the pull-
apart basin geometry. The selected seismic profiles shown in
this paper are also located. Combining the multi-channel
seismic lines, that have a penetration of 3 to 4 s and a poor
definition in the uppermost 0.5 s, with the sparker-pasisar
lines, that have a shallow penetration but high definition,
allows us to discuss the relative age of the various faults
plotted on the map. We first describe the normal faults that
frame the main depocenters. We then discuss the internal
structure of the highs that separate these sub-basins.

   [7] The MMF and the structures related to it dominate the
structural pattern of the 120 elongated Cinarcik basin. The
MMF follows the northern boundary of the basin (Figures 3
and 4). It enters the Cinarcik basin from the west along an
E-W course that cuts across the foot of the margin. Then
after an abrupt 30 bend, the MMF follows the base of the
steep N120E North Cinarcik Basin Scarp (NCBS). The
MMF bend is accommodated by thrusting and folding that
affects the core of the western Cinarcik depocenter [Le

13   Abstract

14          We use about 800 km of multichannel exploration seismic reflection

15   profiles of the seventies as well as the results of three drill holes that penetrated

16   the sedimentary cover down to the Upper Cretaceous basement to describe a

17   continuous gently curvilinear, south-concave zone of deformation about 10 km

18   wide that extended over the whole southern shelf of the Sea of Marmara from the

19   Gulf of Gemlik to the Dardanelles Straits in Lower Pliocene time, about 4 Ma. We

20   call this zone of deformation the South Marmara Fault (SMF) system and propose

21   that the SMF was then a branch of the dextral North Anatolian Fault. This branch

22   passed to the north of the Marmara Island Eocene block and thus had a south

23   facing concavity. This curvature resulted in a significant component of shortening

24   in the western part of the fault. The SMF was deactivated at the end of Lower

25   Pliocene, about 3.5 Ma, except for its easternmost branch between the Gulf of

26   Gemlik and İmralı Island where about 5 mm/yr of dextral motion are still

27   occurring today.

30   Introduction

31          The purpose of this paper is to introduce an hitherto unknown element into

32   the complex fault geometry associated with what Şengör et al. (2005) called the

33   North Anatolian Shear Zone within which the active branches of the North

34   Anatolian Fault later became nucleated (Fig. 1a). Since the work of Şengör (1979)

35   and Şengör et al. (1985) it has been known that the North Anatolian Fault has two

36   main active branches west of the Yeniçağa Depression, east of Bolu (Fig. 1a).

37          An older, southern branch connects the Yeniçağa fork with the Pamukova

38   Basin, where a 22 to 26 km right-lateral offset of the Sakarya River is observed

39   (Şengör et al. 2005). From the Pamukova Basin, the fault continues to the

40   Yenişehir pull-apart from which it goes through the southern margin of the Bursa

41   Depression. A complex series of right-lateral faults defines a broad, elongate

42   basin, not unlike the northern trough in the Sea of Marmara, called the Mysian

43   Trough (Fig. 1a; Şengör et al. 2011). This Trough is dominated by the Manyas

44   and Uluabat (also written as Ulubat: all modern names in this paper are taken

45   from Anonymous, 1977; ancient Apolloniatis) sub-basins not dissimilar to the

46   Central and the Tekirdağ basins of the Sea of Marmara (Le Pichon et al. 2001a, b;

47   MB and UB in Fig. 1b, respectively). These are separated from the southern

48   coastal regions of the Sea of Marmara by a string of mountain ranges: in the east,

49   the Katırlı and Genç Ali mountains form the western prolongation of the Avdan

50   Mountain and continue westward, via the solitary elevation (600 m) south of

51   Zeytinbağı (formerly Trilya), to the Karadağ. The latter culminates at an elevation

52   of 833 m (Erk 1942 fig. 2; Anonymous, 1977, sheet 323-D) and is tilted to the

53   south (Altınlı 1943) along a major, coast-parallel normal-separation oblique fault.

54   The topographic grain within this east-west trending range is north-northeast and


                                                                                          3
55   northeast, as in the Kapıdağ Peninsula (classical Arctonnesus).

56           Sedimentation in the Mysian Trough began in the Pontian (late Miocene)

57   with fluvial sediments and rapidly developed into a lacustrine environment

58   (Şengör et al. 2005). The southern branch of the North Anatolian Fault runs out to

59   the sea along a small rift that is located along the Etili Fault Zone in the middle of

60   the Biga Peninsula. It has a geometry suggesting a pull-apart origin, although its

61   northern part seems not to be faulted (Şengör et al. 2005). The movement along

62   this fault zone seems to have begun in the late Miocene as shown by the ages of

63   the sediment infills of the fault-related basins. In the Etili Rift, the basalts

64   associated with such sedimentary rocks give isotopic ages of 9 to 8.4 Ma (Ercan et

65   al. 1995; Aldanmaz et al. 2000).

66           This southern branch is still active, although it moves much more slowly

67   compared with the northern branch (at most 5 mm/yr vs. 22 mm/yr). However,

68   Şengör et al. (1985) pointed out, and Le Pichon et al. (2003) concurred, that the

69   “fragmented” nature of the Southern Strand shows that a through-going main fault

70   is yet to materialize, at least west of Pamukova (fig. 1a). This shows that this

71   branch has never been a fast moving fault and probably was overtaken by its

72   northern rivals before it could become a through-going feature itself.

73           This has been a surprising feature of the southern strand, because the

74   northern strand did not materialize as a through-going feature until at least the late

75   Pleistocene. The question has long been which features then shared the motion.

76   This paper provides the answer: the North Anatolian Shear Zone has another, now

77   almost completely abandoned intermediary branch, going from the Gulf of

78   Gemlik to the Strait of Dardanelles, skirting the Island of Marmara to the north,

79   which we here call the ‘South Marmara Fault’ (SMF) (Figs. 1a, b and 2). Its

80   presence had not been previously suspected, because it lies buried under the Plio-
                                                                                       4
 81   Quaternary cover of the broad southern Marmara Shelf. Now, with the help of 800

 82   km of previously unpublished multichannel exploration seismic reflection profiles

 83   of the seventies as well as the results of three drill holes that penetrated the

 84   sedimentary cover down to the Upper Cretaceous basement, we have unearthed

 85   the presence of this long, gently south-concave strike-slip South Marmara Fault

 86   that started moving in the later medial Miocene and deactivated in the early

 87   Pliocene (some 3.5 Ma ago).

 88          Geologically, this remarkable feature seems to follow mostly an old zone

 89   of material discontinuity, namely the border between the Intra-Pontide suture zone

 90   with its broad mélanges of mainly Cretaceous to possibly earliest Paleocene age

 91   with succeeding Paleocene-early Eocene flysch abutting the complex basement of

 92   the Sakarya continent to the south (Şengör and Yılmaz, 1981; for newer data

 93   corroborating older observations, see Göncüoğlu et al., 2008, 2012). That this

 94   coincidence is not perfect is a result of the fact that the geometry of the

 95   suture/Sakarya contact is too irregular with a wavelength that makes it impossible

 96   for a strike-slip fault to follow. Interestingly, the northern, the today-active, main

 97   strand of the North Anatolian Fault seems to follow the northern bimaterial

 98   boundary of the Intra-Pontide suture (there the concidence is better, because the

 99   suture boundary is straighter). In places (such as near Bursa) there are indications

100   from the juxtaposition of older basement and early Mesozoic ophiolitic mélanges

101   that the today-active southern branch of the North Anatolian Fault probably also

102   follows a suture, but an older, Palaeo-Tethyan one, namely that of the Karakaya

103   (Fig. 1b; see Şengör and Yılmaz 1981; Şengör et al. 1984; Okay et al. 1996; Okay

104   and Göncüoğlu 2004).

105          As mentioned above, structurally, the South Marmara Fault sits within a

106   high, bordered both to the north and to the south by normal and extensional
                                                                                               5
107   oblique faults. The northern boundary fault of this high, which may be termed the

108   Kara Dağ High after its most prominent eminence (833 m asl), is the South

109   Marmara Fault itself. The southern limit is a series of disconnected normal faults

110   that drop towards the Mysian Trough (Şengör et al. 2005).

111          South of the South Marmara Fault, the basement consists of two main

112   units: a highly metamorphic gneiss+marble association that was deformed and

113   metamorphosed about 384 Ma ago, based on a single zircon-dating using the

114   Kober evaporation technique (A. M. C. Şengör and A. Kröner, unpublished data).

115   This is everywhere tectonically overlain by what is essentially an ophiolitic

116   mélange called the Karakaya Complex (Şengör and Yılmaz 1981; Şengör et al.

117   1984, Okay et al. 1996; Okay and Göncüoğlu 2004). Although Okay (2000)

118   thought it represented the remnants of an oceanic plateau, the components of the

119   Karakaya Complex are far too diverse to allow such a facile interpretation. It most

120   likely represents partly the Palaeo-Tethyan suture and partly an ensimatic

121   arc/marginal basin complex that bordered it. The Karakaya was deformed during

122   the latest Triassic and earliest Jurassic and is overlain by the sandstone of the

123   Bayırköy Formation that heralded a prolonged period of shelf sedimentation that

124   lasted until the end of the Cretaceous (Şengör and Yılmaz 1981).

125          Sometime after the end of the Cretaceous and before the Lutetian, the

126   Sakarya Continent collided with the Rhodope-Pontide south-facing ensialic island

127   arc to the north along a north-dipping subduction zone. The ophiolitic mélanges of

128   the Intra-Pontide suture are overlain by the Korudağ-Ganos flysch wedge that

129   accumulated during the Eocene in an environment of a remnant fore-arc basin

130   within a collision zone. The Thrace Basin overlies this remnant fore-arc area

131   (Görür and Okay 1996; unpublished gravity observations by the Turkish Petrolem

132   Company, indicating the presence of high density material south of the Strandja
                                                                                           6
133   Massif, contradict the interpretation by Elmas, 2012, that the Thracian basin is

134   mostly underlain by the rocks of the Rhodope Massif: Mr. Vasfi Erol, pers.

135   comm., 1981). Eastward, the flysch and mélange fill of the suture zone pinch out

136   and there seems to be much elision of suture material because of an earlier,

137   possibly Eocene-Oligocene strike-slip tectonics. In the Armutlu peninsula, the

138   Palaeozoic of Istanbul lies above the foredeep flysches of the Sakarya Continent

139   across a thrust contact that appears to have cut right into the lower crust as, at the

140   western tip of the Armutlu Peninsula, it exposes what seem to be deep crustal

141   mafic high grade metamorphic rocks (Akbayram et al. 2012; that they may be

142   lower crustal mafic rocks: Dr. Kenan Akbayram, pers. comm.. 2012. Dr.

143   Akbayram also informs us that he no longer subscribes to the early Cretaceous

144   collision hypothesis and has returned to the long-held early Cainozoic

145   interpretation) of late Proterozoic to early Palaeozoic ages (Bozkurt et al., 2013a).

146   Farther east, some Palaeo-Tethyan ophiolites are mixed in with the younger,

147   Permo-Triassic, oceanic rocks of the Intra-Pontide suture in the Almacıkdağ

148   region (Bozkurt et al., 2013b).

149          Shortening, right across the entire area shown in Fig. 1b, continued until

150   the early Miocene, when it was replaced by the establishment of a complex

151   extensional regime shortly afterwards, to be followed by the formation of a broad

152   right-lateral shear zone, the North Anatolian Shear Zone (Şengör et al. 2005).

153   When the shear motion began, the region consisted of a strong basement in the

154   north (The Strandja and the Palaeozoic of Istanbul zones) constituting the

155   Rhodope-Pontide arc massif (see Şengör and Yılmaz 1981). The flysch/mélange

156   fill of the central part made up the Intra-Pontide suture. Finally, in the south, a

157   highly disrupted basement containing bits and pieces of an old, late Palaeozoic

158   basement and the much softer rocks of the Karakaya complex, formed a stronger
                                                                                               7
159   basement than the Intra-Pontide suture, but weaker than that of the Rhodope-

160   Pontide Fragment (Okay et al. 1996; Okay and Göncüoğlu 2004). Le Pichon et al.

161   (2003) already pointed out that the regions south of the main northern strand of

162   the north Anatolian Fault in the Marmara Region were now accomodating more

163   strain than the regions north of it and ascribed this asymmetry to the disparate

164   geological constitutions of the areas. We shall see below that the individual

165   branches of the North Anatolian Fault sensitively pick out bimaterial boundaries

166   to nucleate on, a behaviour theoretically predicted (cf. Weertman 1980; Andrews

167   and Ben-Zion 1997; Ben-Zion and Andrews 1998; Ben Zion 2001).


168   Chronological Arguments: bore hole Marmara 1

169          Borehole Marmara 1 is situated near the northern edge of the Southern

170   Marmara shelf, two thirds of the way between Marmara Island and İmralı Island,

171   near the northern extremity of seismic profile 32 (figure 2). The only information

172   we have on the results of the drilling comes from the final well report (Marathon

173   Petroleum Turkey Limited, 1975) as samples of cuttings and cores no longer exist

174   according to the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPAO), except for the Upper

175   Cretaceous Basement. The following stratigraphic sequence was observed (figure

176   3):

177   Sea floor 126m (0.166s twt):

178          Unconsolidated Quaternary Recent clay

179   Unit 1: 163m to 238 m (0.27s)

180          Post Rift calcareous mudstones of Lower Pliocene age (Pannonian in

181   report); mostly unconsolidated.

182   Unit 2: 236 to 1264 m (0.27s to 1.35s) Average velocity 1.90 Km/s



                                                                                           8
183          Lower Pliocene (Pannonian in report) foreset beds of fluvio-deltaic thickly

184   interbedded sandstones (average porosity, 42%) and mudstones. Dipping on

185   seismic sections is to the SSE. Multiple level soft sediment slumping is common,

186   consistent according to the report, with active faulting during deposition. Namık

187   Çağatay, (private communication, February 8, 2011), considers that the fauna

188   mentioned in the report are not diagnostic of precise stratigraphic ages. He

189   identifies unit 2 with the Alçıtepe Formation on the basis of the presence of

190   foreset beds and calcareous sediments. Çağatay states : “On land, Alçıtepe

191   Formation around Çanakkale, Gallipoli Peninsula and Gulf of Saros appears to

192   comprise both Messinian and Lower Pliocene according to the nannoplankton

193   data of Melinte (Melinte-Dobrinescu et al. 2009; Armijo et al. 1999; Armijo et al.

194   2000).” Melinte et al. (2009) attribute Alçıtepe to the post-Messinian as they

195   believe that it lies on top of what they consider to be the Messinian unconformity.

196   However, Namık Çağatay and Mehmet Sakınç have re-examined the data and

197   they cannot corroborate the existence of the unconformity presumed by Melinte et

198   al. (2009). They emphatically state that the question remains open. Şengör and Le

199   Pichon earlier examined the outcrops in western Gallipoli Peninsula and they too

200   could not locate an unconformity under Alçıtepe. It could be that the canyon filled

201   by the sediments that was observed by Armijo et al. (1999) is not representative of

202   the deformation of the Alçıtepe formation in general.

203   Unit 3: 1264 to 2174m (1.35s to 1.9s) Average velocity 3.3 km/s

204          Lower Pliocene mudstone oxidized and varicolored, with subordinate

205   layers of sandstone (25% average porosity). Both the porosity of the sand layers

206   and the average velocity show that this unit is significantly more consolidated

207   than unit 2. Parallel bedding is identified on seismic profiles according to the

208   report, which states that this unit may be lower Upper Miocene
                                                                                          9
209   (Sarmatian≈Tortonian) at the base. These deposits appear to have been deposited

210   in a “fluvial, alluvial plain, claypan environment”. A layer of red tuffs is present

211   at 1829m. Çağatay (same personal communication as above) tentatively attributes

212   the tuffs to the 9.7 Ma alkali basalt volcanic activity known in this area (Çağatay

213   et al. 2006). Thus unit 3 might be the equivalent of the Kirazlı Formation, which

214   is Upper Miocene. It appears to have been deposited in a quieter environment than

215   unit 2.

216   Unit 4: 2174-2275m (below 1.9 s)

217             Below a major unconformity lie uppermost Cretaceous (Campanian-

218   Maastrichtian) limestones. Similar Upper Cretaceous limestones were penetrated

219   by wells on the Gallipoli Peninsula and crop out on the İmralı Island. Thus the

220   whole sequence of Palaeocene-Eocene-Oligocene-Lower and Middle Miocene is

221   missing and was presumably eroded, which is hardly surprising this close to the

222   suture. This unconformity coincides with the acoustic basement that is well

223   identified on the seismic sections. The absence of the Eocene was a surprise for

224   the drillers as the Eocene formation was the main target of the well as they did not

225   know about the suture.

226             To conclude, well Marmara 1 (figure 4) shows that after a period of strong

227   erosion, a rifting phase with relatively fast subsidence occurred there during upper

228   Miocene (11 to10?-5.3 Ma?) and that it continued into the Uppermost Miocene-

229   Lower Pliocene (Alçıtepe Formation, 5.3?-3.7 to 3.4 Ma?) during which foreset

230   beds of fluvio-deltaic thickly interbedded sandstones and mudstones that might

231   correspond to the Gilbert deltas described by Melinte et al. (2009) were deposited.

232   The source of sediments was to the NW. Tectonic activity appears to have been

233   significantly stronger during the deposition of this unit. The rifting phase was

234   terminated when the Lower Pliocene fresh water calcareous mudstone of unit 1
                                                                                         10
235   was deposited, probably corresponding with the Conkbayırı formation, which is

236   younger than 3.7 to 3.4 Ma (Yaltırak et al. 2000).


237   The shelf east of Marmara Island

238          We now use the stratigraphy of Marmara 1 well, located on seismic profile

239   32, at the northern limit of the Southern Shelf Basin and the southern limit of the

240   Marmara Basin, as a key to interpret seismic section 32, and to extend this

241   interpretation eastward and westward over the whole shelf, using adjacent seismic

242   reflection profiles (see Fig. 2). This interpretation enables us to map a deformation

243   zone, about 10 km wide that can be followed along the whole shelf, from the

244   Gemlik Bay to the east to the Dardanelles Straits to the west. We call it the South

245   Marmara Fault system (SMF) (Fig. 2). The acoustic basement, which coincides

246   with the post Upper Cretaceous erosional unconformity can be identified

247   throughout the section. Unit 3 (the Upper Miocene (Kirazlı) Formation) which is

248   900 m (0.55s) thick at the well increases to nearly 2 km (1.1-1.2s) to the south of

249   the Southern Shelf Basin. There, the basement has been downfaulted by more than

250   2 km, mostly during the Upper Miocene (Kirazlı). In the central part of the

251   section, the basement has been uplifted by more than 1 km, after the rifting,

252   forming a 10 km wide anticlinal fold. The consequent uplift led to the erosion of

253   unit 2 as well as the upper part of unit 3 near the summit of the anticline. This

254   folding was contemporaneous with the formation of the broad zone of

255   deformation of the SMF system while the uppermost SE dipping foreset beds of

256   unit 2 (uppermost Miocene-Lower Pliocene Alçıtepe Formation) were still being

257   deposited to the south. It is important to note that the source of the sediments

258   during the deposition of units 2 and 3 was to the NW and not to the south.



                                                                                          11
259          The quality of the seismic profile is not such that the style of deformation

260   can be unambiguously determined. However, the central part of the deformation

261   zone, near the apex of the uplifted basement, coincides with a flower structure that

262   we interpret as compressive. Figure 1 shows that this zone of deformation can be

263   followed both westward to the Marmara Island and eastward to the İmralı Island.

264   Profile LD 70 (Fig.6), between profile 32 and Marmara Island, demonstrates that

265   the uplift of the basement by 1.5 km increases westward toward Marmara Island

266   and that both units 2 and 3 above the anticline have been conformably folded and

267   strongly eroded. Thus the uplift occurred near the end of Lower Pliocene. Profile

268   60 (Fig. 7), halfway between profiles 70 and 32, confirms the strong uplift and

269   folding of the basement as well as its conformable Upper Miocene - Lower

270   Pliocene cover. This deformation is definitely post-unit 3 (Kirazlı) and probably

271   contemporaneous with the deposition of the upper part of unit 2 (Alçıtepe). The

272   interpretation to the north of shot point 300 is tentative but there is no doubt that a

273   post-Alçıtepe E/W normal fault marks the edge of the shelf to the north. Figure 8

274   shows a NW/SE chirp profile across the northern part of profile 60 near shot point

275   230, which displays eroded sedimentary layers with a component of dip to the SE.

276   These eroded layers most probably belong to the lower part of unit 2.

277          The Marmara Island (ancient Proconnesus), to the west, is made up of

278   north dipping metamorphic thrust sheets interlayered with metagranitoid

279   intrusions dated by Ustaömer et al. (2009) as Lutetian (47.6 ± 0.2 Ma). The pluton

280   underwent severe brittle-ductile deformation, following its mid-Eocene

281   emplacement, with the development of both a N-dipping foliation and an WNW-

282   ESE doubly-plunging stretching lineation. These structures indicate a top to south

283   motion and record the formation and the tightening of the Intra-Pontide suture

284   (Ustaömer et al. 2009). The seismic profiles to the east of Marmara Island indicate
                                                                                      12
285   that Marmara Island must have been uplifted and broadly warped by about 1.5 to

286   2 km near the end of Lower Pliocene. An examination of a slope map of the island

287   confirms the broad E-W anticlinal upwarp of the island. We do not have the

288   information necessary to determine whether part of the SMF system entered the

289   northern part of Marmara Island, possibly reactivating the Eocene thrusts, or

290   whether the whole zone of deformation was deflected to the north of the island, on

291   the edge of the shelf, to avoid the Kapıdağ Peninsula-Marmara Island basement

292   block. This is because the later normal faulting that created the present Marmara

293   Basin at the end of Lower Pliocene had encroached on and at least partly

294   obliterated the SMF system immediately north of the Marmara Island.

295          At the eastern extremity of the part of the area we have just discussed, the

296   zone of deformation appears to enter the northernmost İmralı Island. An

297   examination of a slope map of İmralı Island shows that the southern two thirds of

298   the island appear to form a broad N/S fold while the northern extremity is marked

299   by an E/W elevated high with steep topography to the north, most probably

300   coinciding with major E/W faults. The sharp bend of the SMF system, from E-W

301   to SE, near İmralı Island may coincide with a change from a principally reverse

302   component of motion to the west to a normal one to the east. This change would

303   be expected, as the main motion on the SMF system was dextral. Unfortunately,

304   as for the northern Marmara Island, the later normal faulting that created the

305   present Marmara Basin and now roughly coincides with the edge of the shelf has

306   also encroached on and partly obliterated the earlier deformation zone

307   immediately north of İmralı Island, as it did north of Marmara Island.

308   Furthermore, although profiles 14 and 9a to the east of İmralı confirm the

309   presence of the SMF system east of İmralı Island (see fig.2), the style of

310   deformation is difficult to unambiguously characterize.
                                                                                        13
311          Further east, in Gemlik Bay, Kuşçu et al. (2009) have mapped a set of

312   active dextral faults that are in the direct prolongation of the SMF system.

313   Gasperini and Polonia (2009) have evaluated a rate of 5 mm/yr for the dextral

314   strike slip across the Gemlik Bay. It is thus probable that the SM Fault extended

315   eastward into the Gemlik Bay and that the portion east of İmralı Island is still

316   active today and now extends northwestward into the southern slope of the

317   Marmara Basin. In a recent IODP meeting, Günay Çifci and Seda Okay presented

318   a High Resolution seismic profile near İmralı Island which may indicate that this

319   present activity of the SMF extends somewhat west of İmralı (Pierre Henry,

320   personal communication, October 2012).


321   The shelf west of Marmara Island

322          As mentioned above, the SMF system is offset to the north as it enters the

323   Marmara Island uplift. Most of it has probably been reactivated to form the slope

324   of the Marmara Basin at the end of Lower Pliocene. Further west, the SMF can be

325   recognized again to the NW of Marmara Island, coming out of the southern

326   Tekirdağ Basin, near 40°40’N and 27°20’E. It is then abruptly offset by 5 km to

327   the SSW along a fault near 27°25°E. This NNW/SSE fault appears to mark the

328   western limit of the broad basement uplift to which the Kapıdağ Peninsula, the

329   Marmara Island and a set of smaller islands belong (figure 2).

330          West of this fault, starting with profile 99, the SMF system can be

331   precisely mapped with the help of closely spaced seismic profiles and of two

332   wells that penetrated the whole sedimentary sequence, Doluca-1 borehole on

333   profile 102 and Işıklar-1 borehole on profile 114 (fig.2, fig.3, fig.9, fig.10).

334   Unfortunately, the detailed final reports of the two wells are not available any

335   more. However, records at TPAO indicate that below 54 m. of water, Doluca-1

                                                                                          14
336   drill hole penetrated a Middle Miocene formation described as Gazhanedere and

337   reached the basement immediately below it at a depth of 800 m (fig.2). The

338   basement is described as ophiolitic mélange and was penetrated over a thickness

339   of 300 m. It is considered to be pre-Neogene. Thus the whole Neogene

340   sedimentary section below the Middle Miocene is missing, as in borehole

341   Marmara-1. The Gazhanedere Formation is stratigraphically below the Upper

342   Miocene formation and corresponds to the Middle Miocene (Burdigalian to

343   Serravallian, 17-10 Ma, Çağatay et al. 2006). If the identification is correct, the

344   Upper Miocene (Kirazlı formation) and the Lower Pliocene (Alçıtepe formation)

345   have been eroded to the north of profile 102 (fig.8) but are present in the central

346   part of the profile where they have been affected by steep thrust and presumably

347   dextral faulting of the SMF system. A presumably Upper Pliocene to Pleistocene

348   section unconformably overlies the Lower Pliocene and Upper to Middle Miocene

349   layers affected by the deformation. Thus the activity of the SMF system most

350   likely has the same age west of Marmara Island as it has east of it.

351          Fifteen km west of profile 102, profile 114 (fig.10) is calibrated by

352   borehole Işıklar-1 (Fig. 3). The drill hole penetrated below 68 m. of water, 278 m.

353   of conglomerate, sandstone and mudstone described as the Upper Miocene

354   Gazhanedere Formation with an average velocity of 2 155 m/s, and thus poorly

355   consolidated. However, as mentioned above, the Gazhanedere Formation

356   corresponds to the Middle Miocene but in the absence of samples and detailed

357   stratigraphic descriptions, the validity of this dating cannot be verified. Then the

358   drill hole penetrated 239 m. of turbidites of the Upper Eocene Ceylan Formation,

359   110 m. of limestones of the Upper-Middle Eocene Soğucak formation and 136 m.

360   of clastics of the Middle Eocene Koyunbaba Formation. The average velocity of

361   this 485 m. Eocene sequence is 3 465 m/s. The Eocene formation is thus much
                                                                                            15
362   better consolidated than the Miocene sediments deposited on top of it after an

363   important episode of erosion. Finally, the drill hole penetrated over 32 m. of

364   basement described as ophiolitic mélange (as in Doluca – 1) with an average

365   velocity of 4 000 m/s. Profile 114 shows that the well was drilled on top of an

366   anticlinal warp that resulted in the erosion of the upper and late Miocene layers.

367   Reverse faults, forming a flower in the summit area of the anticlinal warp are post

368   - Middle Miocene and probably of the same Late Lower Pliocene age as further

369   east. The difference there is that the Eocene is still present as in the Gelibolu

370   Peninsula area to the north.


371   From the shelf west of Marmara Island to the
372   Dardanelles Straits

373          The available seismic profiles allow us to trace the SMF system to

374   26°50’E, off the Biga Peninsula, just east of the entrance to the Dardanelles

375   Straits. The dating of the post – Miocene tectonics of the area around the

376   Dardanelles Straits has been the subject of several studies recently (Armijo et al.

377   1990; Yaltırak et al. 2000; Armijo et al. 2000; Şengör et al. 2005; Şen et al. 2009;

378   Melinte et al. 2009). All studies relate the tectonics to the Ganos branch of the

379   dextral North Anatolian Fault (Fig. 11). All note the significant folding and

380   thrusting of the SW Thrace Basin within the Gelibolu area extending into and

381   beyond the Dardanelles Straits that involve upper Miocene deposits, with steep,

382   up to vertical dips, tight secondary folds, and locally reverse faults and thrusts.

383   These structures, kilometers to 10’s of kilometers long, are subparallel to each

384   other and to the trend of the Dardanelles Straits and of the Ganos Fault. They are

385   thus also subparallel to the SMF system, having the same curvature.



                                                                                            16
386          Immediately north of the Dardanelles Straits, a prominent anticline is

387   bordered to the south by a thrust fault called the Anafartalar Fault. Most of the

388   studies propose that the main tectonic event there took place during the deposition

389   of the mid-Pliocene (3.7 - 3.4 Ma) Conkbayırı Formation in an alluvial fan

390   environment in front of the transpressional Anafartalar thrust (see Yaltırak et al.

391   2000; see also Şen et al. 2009). Armijo et al. (1999, 2000) do not agree as they

392   claim that the significant unconformity is at the base of the older Alçıtepe

393   Formation, that they proposed to be post-Messinian, and that the Alçıtepe

394   Formation is essentially undeformed. Thus the end of tectonic activity for them

395   would coincide with the end of the Messinian and be 5.3 Ma, not 3.7 – 3.4 Ma.

396   But this claim does not appear to us to be substantiated (see our discussion above)

397   and we do not follow their interpretation.

398          The data that we have discussed above lead us to propose that at least part

399   of the latest to post-Miocene deformation in the Dardanelles Straits and in the

400   Gelibolu area to the north of it is due to the extension of the SMF system in the

401   Dardanelles area, and not to the initiation of the present Ganos branch of the

402   North Anatolian Fault. However, there is the possibility that as the SMF system

403   was abandoned, the fault jumped northward by about 15 km in this area and

404   initiated the Ganos branch of the North Anatolian Fault that is remarkably parallel

405   to the SMF system west of Marmara Island and that deformation of both systems

406   overlap.

407          We stress again that our data suggest that this deformation is post-Alçıtepe

408   and thus about 3.5 Ma and not pre-Alçıtepe, or about 5.3 Ma as proposed by

409   Armijo et al. (1999). We believe that an investigation should be made of whether

410   the canyon filled by the Alçıtepe sediments that was observed by Armijo et al.


                                                                                            17
411   (1999) is not representative of the deformation of the Alcitepe formation in

412   general.


413   Discussion and Conclusion

414            The one clear and significant result of this study is the discovery of a

415   hitherto unknown and now largely dead branch of the North Anatolian Fault. It

416   lies between the highly active northern branch and the weakly active (but still

417   capable of generating magnitude 7 earthquakes on a possibly demi-millenial

418   repeat time in any one locality) southern branch. The new fault, which we here

419   call the South Marmara Fault (SMF), is located within a relative high, as opposed

420   to the location of the Northern and the Southern Branches that are located within

421   deeps.

422            Both the Northern and Southern Marmara branches should be slightly

423   extensional in the present system if you apply the average Anatolia/Eurasia

424   rotation to both (see figure 5 of Le Pichon and Kreemer 2010). Indeed, these two

425   faults became segmented and developed deeps along them that are wedge-basins

426   and negative flowers, the Çınarcık Basin in the eastern part of the Sea of Marmara

427   being the largest of these basins. On the other hand, in this rotational system, the

428   part of the SMF east of Marmara Island should be extensional and west of it

429   compressional, which is approximately what one observes. This is because the

430   SMF had to bend around the Kara Dağ High.

431            But why did the main fault within the Marmara Shear Zone did migrate

432   northward from its initiation in Mid-Miocene to the present? As the slip rate

433   increased along the NAF, as proposed by Şengör et al. (2005), the orientation of

434   the Hellenic subduction progressively changed from southward to southwestward

435   and the northwestern end of the Hellenic subduction consequently migrated

                                                                                          18
436   northward to its present position. This led to the northward migration of the

437   prolongation of the NAF in the Marmara-Aegean area to join the northward

438   migrating northwestern extremity of the Hellenic subduction (see figure 5 of Le

439   Pichon and Kreemer 2010).

440          The evolution we propose is that in the medial Miocene, the Marmara

441   shear zone formed of numerous roughly east-west orientated dextral fault

442   segments which functioned in various ways of across-strike strains, but always

443   dextrally in along-strike strains. Some rotated individually, others with their

444   neighbours. This process is seen today in its incipient form along the southern

445   strand where there is no throughgoing fault similar to the one along the very

446   active northern strand. But the main motion was progressively transferred

447   northward, first to the South Marmara Fault, that seems to have died shortly or

448   immediately after it had become a through going feature, because the northern

449   branch had started taking up more and more of the motion for the reasons we have

450   proposed above.

451          Our conclusions were written before the 2013. 01. 08 earthquake that

452   occurred at 16:16:06 local time and had an Mw=6.2. The following information

453   about this earthquake and its largest aftershock was kindly supplied by Dr. Doğan

454   Kalafat of the Kandilli Observatory in Istanbul. The hypocenter was given as 8.4

455   km. The earthquake occurred on the direct southwesterly continuation of the

456   South Marmara fault and showed a pure right-lateral strike-slip. The largest

457   aftershock (Mw=4.6) had exactly the same characteristics and occurred or the

458   same fault some 10 km to the northeast of the main shock. All other aftershocks

459   cluster around the southwestern extension of the South Marmara Fault. There is

460   very weak seismicity along the rest of the South Marmara Fault, showing that

461   such faults do not die at once. Segments of them remain active, as the latest
                                                                                        19
462   Aegean earthquakes referred to above show and most likely they take up motion

463   from neighbouring segments. There is hardly a serious offset at the occidental

464   termination of the southernmost branch of the North Anatolian Fault and this has

465   long concerned those studying the westernmost part of the southernmost branch of

466   the North Anatolian Fault. We propose that this is because the southernmost

467   branch transfers its offset to the occidental end of the South Marmara Fault across

468   a series of poorly-known wrench fault segments in the westernmost part of the

469   Biga Peninsula.

470          The data presented in this paper have very important implications for the

471   evolution of strike-slip shear zones, in other words entire keirogens. In both

472   orogens and taphrogens faulting progresses either in a foreward (forefolding) or

473   backward (backfolding) sense and after a time, both senses are seen

474   simultaneously at both flanks of an orogen or a taphrogen. This is because gravity

475   influences faulting as faulting changes the potential energy of rock masses.

476   Keirogens do not in principle change the potential energy of the rock volumes

477   they affect and the spatial evolution of faulting in them is much more irregular

478   and is controlled mainly by strain hardening or strain weakening and the presence

479   of pre-existing weak zones and by the forces applied at the boundaries. In the case

480   of the North Anatolian Shear Zone, the presence of the Intra-Pontide and the

481   Karakaya sutures has profoundly affected the placement of the major fault strands.

482   In the western part of the Biga Peninsula, the presence of several strands of

483   serpentinite screens, possibly formed by former, collision-related escape

484   structures repeating parts of the Intra-Pontide suture, may have facilitated motion

485   transfer from the southern branch to the South Marmara Fault.

594   Figure 1a: Map showing the setting of the South Marmara Fault within the

595   context of the North Anatolian Shear Zone (Şengör et al., 2005).


596   Figure 1b: A schematic map showing the tectonic ecology of the newly-

597   discovered South Marmara Fault (SMF). Everything before the Miocene is here

598   considered ‘basement’ i.e., the edifice all branches of the North Anatolian Fault

599   had to disrupt to come into existence. Black lines are medial Miocene to younger

600   right-lateral strike slip faults (all belonging to the north Anatolian Shear Zone).

601   Blue lines mark the location of the faults belonging to the South Marmara Fault.

602   Note that the northern branch of the North Antolian Fault closely follows the

603   contact between the Palaeozoic of Istanbul and the Sakarya basement and then

604   jumps to follow the northern boundary of the Intra-Pontide suture. It is clear that

605   the fault has chosen here a bimaterial boundary as it did farther in the east (see

606   Şengör et al., 2005). The newly-discovered SMF does the same thing in the south,

607   following the contact between the Sakarya basement and the Intra-Pontide suture.

608   This map shows how critically important it is to set neotectonic features into the

609   framework of palaeotectonic ones to establesh what controlled the course of the

610   former. The extent of the Intra-Pontide suture in submarine areas is drawn by

611   interpolating the land-basen observations, except south of the Lagoon of

612   Büyükçekmece (just north of the letter N where it is written NAF), where the

613   seismic reflexion data show the edge of the Thracian Basin clearly.

619   Figure 5: Seismic section 32. See location in figure 1. Bottom: TPAO seismic

620   section. Top: Line drawing. Thick black, Upper Cretaceous basement. Green,

621   Upper Miocene (Kirazlı) rifting faults at the origin of the southern shelf basin. See

622   location of Marmara-1 well. Red, Lower Pliocene (Alçıtepe) mostly reverse and

623   transcurrent faults associated with the formation and evolution of the South

624   Marmara Fault (SMF). Blue, post-Alçıtepe normal faults associated with the

625   subsidence of the Marmara basin to the north. Note the Lower Pliocene uplift of

626   the central part of the section, which is syntectonic with the activity of the MSS

627   Fault (figure 1).


628   Figure 6: Seismic section 70. See location in figure 1. Bottom: TPAO seismic

629   section. Top: Line drawing. See figure 4 for legend. Note that units 2 and 3 are

630   folded conformably with the uplifted Upper Cretaceous basement. The uplift and

631   consequent folding is syn- to post Alçıtepe.


632   Figure 7: Seismic section 60. See location on figure 1. Bottom: TPAO section.

633   Top: line drawing. See figure 4 for legend. Note the strong uplift and folding of

634   the basement and its sedimentary cover to the south with the apex of folding just

635   south of shot point 300. The profile is more difficult to interpret to the north and

636   the interpretation we propose there may be discussed.




                                                                                           28
637   Figure 8 is a chirp profile across the northern portion of profile 60 from cruise

638   Marnaut (courtesy of Pierre Henry 2010). Note the eroded sedimentary layers

639   with a component of dip to the SE. They probably belong to unit 2.


640   Figure 9: Seismic section 102. See location in figure 1. Bottom: TPAO seismic

641   section. Top: Line drawing. Doluca-1 well is close to the northern extremity of the

642   profile. Thick black, Upper Cretaceous basement. Red, Lower Pliocene (Alçıtepe)

643   mostly reverse and transcurrent faults associated with the formation and evolution

644   of the South Marmara Fault (SMF). Note the strong erosion of the Late Miocene

645   section at the northern end of the section and the absence of the whole Neogene

646   section, the acoustic basement coinciding in well Doluca-1 with what is described

647   as an ophiolitic mélange of probable Upper Cretaceous age.

649   section. Top: Line drawing. Işıklar-1 well lies in the middle of the profile. Thick

650   black, Upper Cretaceous basement. Red, Lower Pliocene (Alçıtepe) mostly

651   reverse and transcurrent faults associated with the formation and evolution of the

652   South Marmara Fault (SMF). Note the erosion of the Uppermost Miocene and the

653   Lower Pliocene in the central part of the section.

655   and seismic profiles is complemented by a bathymetric map over the Sea of

656   Marmara and a topographic map on land. Structures in the Sea of Marmara are

658   after Ş. Şen et al. (2009). Structures in the Gulf of Gemlik are after İ. Kuşçu et al.

659   (2009).

          Abstract. – The Eocene shortening directions along the Southern Provence fold-and-thrust belt are commonly assumed
          to be N-S. We present here new observations and data that allow reinterpreting the structure of the La Nerthe range as a
          right-lateral transpressive flower structure. Structural data collected along the range argue for an Eocene N145o shorten-
          ing event. The age of this shortening event is constrained by the fact that faulting and folding affect the Late Creta-
          ceous-Paleocene continental deposits along the northern flank of the La Nerthe range and is sealed by the Miocene
          marine deposits. Moreover striated fault planes display both horizontal and vertical striae suggesting that they were re-
          activated during the Oligocene extensional event. We question here the shortening directions along the Southern Pro-
          vence thrust belt. Structural data suggest both N-S and NNW-SSE shortening directions during the Eocene. During the
          Eocene the Provence area was in the foreland of a complex orogenic belt that extended from the Betic Cordillera to the
          Corsica-Sardinia block. This orogenic belt developed along the subduction linked to the convergence between Africa
          and Eurasia. Although the convergence vector was nearly N-S the NE-SW orientation of the trench may have led to a
          complex deformation pattern along the orogenic belt with NW-SE and N-S shortening directions that reflected both the
          along-trench compression and the regional convergence.

          Résumé. – Il est généralement admis que les directions de raccourcissements à l’origine des chaînons sud-provençaux
          étaient N-S. Nous présentons ici de nouvelles observations permettant de réinterpréter le chaînon de La Nerthe comme
          une structure transpressive dextre. Les données structurales collectées suggèrent un raccourcissement éocène orienté
          N145o. L’âge de la déformation est contraint par le fait que les structures affectent les dépôts continentaux d’âge crétacé
          supérieur-paléocène et sont scellés par les dépôts marins miocènes. De plus certains plans présentent des stries vertica-
          les recoupant les stries décrochantes ce qui suggère une réactivation durant la distension oligocène. Nous abordons la
          question des directions de raccourcissement à l’origine des chaînons sud-provençaux. Les données collectées suggèrent
          à la fois un raccourcissement N-S et NW-SE pendant l’Eocène. Durant l’Eocène la Provence était en position d’a-
          vant-pays par rapport à la ceinture orogénique qui s’étendait de la cordillère bétique jusqu’au bloc Corso-Sarde. Cette
          dernière est liée à la subduction résultant de la convergence entre l’Afrique et l’Eurasie. Bien que le vecteur conver-
          gence ait été N-S l’orientation NE-SW de la fosse peut avoir engendré un partitionnement de la déformation avec des
          directions NW-SE et N-S reflétant à la fois la composante normale à la fosse et la convergence régionale.

Metamorphic and geochronological data suggest that the
piling was initiated in the middle Eocene (~45 Ma), while
extension started probably in the lower Oligocene (~33 Ma)
and lasted until the middle Oligocene (27 Ma) without
change in orientation. This second deformation phase leads
to the progressive exhumation of the deepest units, partly
controlled by a strong tectonic denudation. The kinematical
directions of this reconstituted structural evolution, re-
placed in their initial position and orientation (i.e. before
the opening of the Ligurian basin) imply an approximate
NW-SE shortening direction, the vergence of the nappe
being to the southeast.

Eocene kinematics of the Iberian-Provence-Corsica-
Sardinia domain
Recently Lacombe and Jolivet [2005] analyzed the Eocene
geometry of the Provence area on the basis of the observa-
tion that the southern Provence area was in the foreland of
Alpine Corsica before the rifting of the Liguro-Provençal
basin (fig. 10). In their model Corsica and Provence re-
corded a progressive shortening between 60 and 30 Ma ow-
ing to Africa-Eurasia convergence at the junction of the
Pyrenean and the Alpine thrust belts. The continental crust
was shortened in the back arc domain of the future
Apennine subduction with backthrusts verging toward Eu-
rope and western Corsica being overthrust onto the Pro-
vence foreland. Corsica, the future Apennines, and
Provence together thus make a complete double-verging
mountain belt with internal zones in Alpine Corsica and
northern foreland in Provence in the Eocene.
    Structural data presented here strongly suggest a
N140o-N150o shortening along the southern Provence area.        FIG. 10. – Schematic diagram showing the particular setting of the southern

                                          (Received 17 February 2003; accepted 28 August 2003)

              Abstract – Western Turkey is one of the most spectacular regions of widespread active continental
              extension in the world. The most prominent structures of this region are E–W-trending grabens (e.g.
              Gediz and Büyük Menderes grabens) and intervening horsts, exposing the Menderes Massif. This paper
              documents the result of a recent field campaign (field geological mapping and structural analysis) along
              the southern margin of the modern Gediz Graben of Pliocene (∼ 5 Ma) age. This work provides field
              evidence that the presently low-angle ductile-brittle detachment fault is cut and displaced by the high-
              angle graben-bounding normal faults with total displacement exceeding 2.0 km. The evolution of the
              N–S extension along the Gediz Graben occurred during two episodes, each characterized by a distinct
              structural styles: (1) rapid exhumation of Menderes Massif in the footwall of low-angle normal fault
              (core-complex mode) during the Miocene; (2) late stretching of crust producing E–W grabens along
              high-angle normal faults (rift mode) during Pliocene–Quaternary times, separated by a short-time
              gap. The later phase is characterized by the deposition of now nearly horizontal sediments of Pliocene
              age in the hanging walls of the high-angle normal faults and present-day graben floor sediments. The
              evolution of extension is at variance with orogenic collapse and/or back-arc extension followed by
              the combined effect of tectonic escape and subduction rollback processes along the Aegean-Cyprean
              subduction zone. Consequently, it is misleading to describe the Miocene sediments exhumed on
              shoulders of the Gediz Graben as simple graben fill.

gorge through the base of Miocene sediments and into the Menderes Massif metamorphics, thus allowing to observe the relationships
between the different structures of the Gediz graben. As is seen clearly the low-angle fault developed above marble and dips gently

different angle (view to the north towards the Gediz Graben). In this photograph, the detachment surface lies well above the present-day
configuration of the Gediz Graben; in fact, it is hanging above Miocene sediments exhumed along the southern margin of the Gediz
Graben. Gediz Graben floor lies in the foreground (GG) and the elevation difference between the detachment fault and the graben floor
is pronounced. The top of the metamorphic rocks of the Menderes Massif is reached at a depth of 1.3 km in the Gediz graben, thus
suggesting that the detachment surface displacement exceeds 2.0 km. See Figure 2b for locations. White arrows indicate the sense of

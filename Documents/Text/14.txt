depth (Fig. 1B). The northern 20 km of the fault
trace has been identified on the continental shelf
(Figs. 3A and 4D), largely using bathymetric
profiles acquired by the Royal New Zealand
Navy. The fault crosses Entrance Basin (a
glacier scour) at the mouth of Milford Sound,
and to the south, lies 1–2 km from the coast in
~30–50 m water depth. The surface trace is con-
tinuous with, and closely resembles, the south-
ern Westland section exposed on land (Fig. 3C).
The fault strikes 054°, 11° from the azimuth of
Pacific-Australian Plate motion (Fig. 4E), and is
characterized by almost purely dextral strike-
slip displacement, associated with a low-relief
(<20 m high) landward-facing surface scarp
upthrown to the northwest (Figs. 3A and 4C).
The fault displaces laterally a prominent ridge
on the shelf just southwest of Milford Sound
(Fig. 3B). Seabed photographs of a similar
feature on the northern side of Entrance Basin

imply that the ridge is a glacial moraine with
large boulders scattered on its surface (Barnes
and Pickrill, 2003). Onshore, along the north-
east side of Transit Valley, lateral moraine
conspicuously lines the base of the valley wall
and forms a sharp moraine ridge that is very
straight and ~1500 m long. It is truncated by
the modern sea cliff, but its straight geometry
allows moderately accurate extrapolation over
the ~1000 m to the Alpine Fault trace. The crest
of the offset moraine ridge is dextrally displaced
by 450 ± 150 m, depending on which part of
the ridge is correlated with onshore (Fig. 3B).
Assuming that glaciers retreated from the coast
some 20–17 k.y. ago (Sutherland and Norris,
1995), the displacement indicates a dextral slip
rate of 25 ± 10 mm/yr, which is comparable to
that 20 km north of Milford Sound.
   The Milford-Caswell section traverses onto
the upper continental slope off Sutherland
Sound, and there appears to be a gentle, 400 m
wide right bend in the surface trace where
it enters the northern end of the 25 km long
George Basin (Fig. 3A). A major fault escarp-
ment up to 600 m in height bounds the linear
northwestern margin of the basin, separating
the basin floor from Bligh Ridge (Figs. 3A
and 4D). The southern part of the basin and
ridge straddles a broad left bend in the strike
of the fault, from 050° at Bligh Sound to 038°
immediately south of George Sound. In eight
seismic profiles the structure of Bligh Ridge is
not well imaged, although the ridge appears to
be very gently folded, with reflections truncated
against the fault scarp (Fig. 5). A northwest-dip-
ping splay in the center of George Basin, 1 km
from the Alpine Fault, is associated with an
extensional graben in the south (Fig. 5A) and
a constrictional push-up ridge that inverts basin
stratigraphy in the north (Fig. 5B). The small

but the contraction normal to the fault is very
small relative to the inferred strike-slip displace-
ments. These features include (1) gentle folding
of Bligh Ridge and the small push-up ridge in
George Basin (Fig. 5B); (2) reverse separation
on the southern Milford-Caswell section at Cas-
well Fan (Fig. 7B), and on parts of the Nancy
section, particularly at Colonial Ridge (Figs. 7B
and 8B); and (3) uplift of Dagg Ridge between
an oblique reverse splay and the Resolution sec-
tion (Fig. 11B). Fault growth strata in the basins
show that where such transpressional deforma-
tion occurs, it is active contemporaneously with
the extension and subsidence at the fault step-
overs and releasing bends. Such coexistence of
apparently contrasting deformational structures
is a common characteristic of many other major
strike-slip faults and their sedimentary basins
(e.g., Crowell, 1974; Christie-Blick and Biddle,
1985; Sylvester, 1988; Wood et al., 1994;
Barnes and Audru, 1999; Le Pichon et al., 2001)
and does not necessarily indicate a transpres-
sional overprinting. Localized transpressional
deformations may relate to constrictional fault
geometries developed during reactivation of
existing faults, fault rotations as basins evolve
and migrate, and various interactions between
branching splays. Nevertheless, we cannot dis-
count the possibility that the 10° rotation and
left bending of the southern Alpine Fault during
the last 3 m.y. has increased the occurrence of
transpressional structures (Lebrun et al., 2000).
The closest (3–6 km) active reverse fault north-
west of the Alpine Fault locally defines the rear
of the accretionary wedge northwest of Dagg
Basin (Figs. 10 and 11). This 20–30-km-long
structure probably splays off the Alpine Fault

Keywords:                                                  With its central position between the Tibetan Plateau and the Tian Shan Range, the Tarim Basin is a key element
Asian Cenozoic deformation                                 of the Cenozoic Asian orogenic system. However, a comprehensive regional study, and more particularly the
Tarim Basin                                                quantification of shortening through this basin and its margins, are still needed to understand its role in the
Western Kunlun                                             Cenozoic deformation of Asia. From a compilation of previous works, together with an extensive dataset of

Shortening
Balanced geological cross-sections                         we characterize the Cenozoic deformation of the original Proterozoic Tarim block. From structural restorations
                                                           and crustal budgets, we also quantify the compressive component of this deformation. Most of the Cenozoic
                                                           compressive deformation (from ~94% to 100%) is concentrated in the ranges along the block margins. To the
                                                           west, up to 78 ± 23 km and 54 +24/−18 km of crustal shortening are accommodated across the compressive
                                                           Western Kunlun and Southwestern Tian Shan ranges, while to the east, up to 38.6 ± 18 km and 15 + 20/
                                                           −15 km are accommodated across the transpressive Altyn Tagh and Southeastern Tian Shan ranges. A non-
                                                           negligible amount of compressive deformation (up to ~6%) is also accommodated within the Tarim Basin by
                                                           large basement-cored uplifts with a vergence synthetic to the deformation of the Tibetan Plateau edge. To the
                                                           west, the Bachu uplift absorbs ~5 km of the total crustal shortening of the Western Kunlun thrust system, while
                                                           to the south, the Tanan uplift accumulates ~0.6 km of the Altyn Tagh strike-slip system. Structural inheritance
                                                           has a major influence on the Cenozoic deformation since ~33.3% to 100% of the total shortening is accom-
                                                           modated by reactivated basement structures inherited from the Protero-Paleozoic history of the Tarim block.
                                                           Finally, we argue that the basement-cored uplifts in the centre of the basin imply a deformation transfer from the
                                                           Tibetan Plateau to the Tian Shan, above a deep crustal decollement decoupling the deforming crust from an

from the SRTM3 DEM and averaged every 50 km in the range (green dashed line). This average topography corresponds to the main input for assessing the Moho
depth below the ranges by isostatic calculations. (B) Example of a simplified crustal-scale cross-section used to estimate the shortening accommodated across the
ranges surrounding the Tarim Basin from crustal budgets (see Supplementary information S2 for methodology). To assess the Moho depth below the ranges by
isostatic calculations, a reference in a stable place (i.e. with no Cenozoic deformation or flexure) is required. This stable isostatic reference was taken in the centre of
the basin, between kilometres 300 and 350 along transect C, where there is no structures activated during the Cenozoic (Figs. 7C and S4C1). Arange: crustal area below
the range, Ased: area of the Cenozoic sediments coming from the range erosion (i.e. crustal area of the range lost by erosion), H0: initial crustal thickness at the
beginning of Cenozoic, L1: present-day length of the range, L0: initial crustal length at the beginning of Cenozoic, d: density. (C) Intermediate state of construction for
the synthetic crustal-scale cross-sections. Structures from the surface down to 20 km deep are constrained by the regional balanced geological transects (Fig. 7B).
Structures below 20 km deep are inferred from the isostatic calculations and the basin geometry achieved in this study, and from the deep geophysical data available
in the area (e.g., Li et al., 2002b; Jiang et al., 2004; Wittlinger et al., 2004). Examples of a lithospheric yield strength profile (from Zhang et al., 2013b) and of

Shortening values are provided for (1) the entire (inner plus outer) ranges, (2) the inner ranges, (3) the outer ranges, (4) the basin, and (5) the entire orogenic
systems. Shortening values for the entire ranges (1) are derived from crustal budgets (Figs. 12 and S4; Supplementary material S2). Those for the outer ranges (3) and
for the basin (4) are derived from structural restorations (Fig. 7). For the outer ranges, the contributions to the shortening of the (Protero-)Paleozoic inherited (inh.)
and Cenozoic neoformed (neo.) structures are indicated in brackets. Shortening values for the inner ranges (2) correspond to the differences between the shortenings
across the entire ranges (1) and those accumulated in their outer parts (3). Finally, the total shortening amounts accommodated across the whole orogenic systems (5)
are obtained by adding the shortening values accommodated across the entire ranges (1) and in the basin (4). Values given for shortenings derived from crustal
budgets correspond to the most probable values according to our regional balanced geological transects (Cenozoic sediment thicknesses) and to other published
parameters (densities and sediment porosity) used for calculations. Uncertainties given for these values correspond to possible errors on the crustal areas below the
range (coming from the densities) and on the crustal areas lost by erosion (coming from the sediment porosity) (see Supplementary information S2 for more
explanations).

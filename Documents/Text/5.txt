                   Abstract: We document the establishment of the Aegea–Anatolia/Eurasia plate boundary in Pliocene–Pleistocene time. Before
                   2 Ma, no localized plate boundary existed north of the Aegean portion of the Anatolia plate and the shear produced by the motion
                   of Anatolia–Aegea with respect to Eurasia was distributed over the whole width of the Aegean – West Anatolian western portion.
                   In 4.5 Ma, a shear zone comparable to the Gulf of Corinth was formed in the present Sea of Marmara. The initial extensional
                   basins were cut by the strike-slip Main Marmara Fault system after 2.5 Ma. Shortly after, the plate boundary migrated west of the
                   Sea of Marmara along the northern border of Aegea from the North Aegean Trough, to the Gulf of Corinth area and to the Kefalonia
                   Fault. There, it ﬁnally linked with the northern tip of the Aegean subduction zone, completing the system of plate boundaries
                   delimiting the Anatolia–Aegea plate. We have related the change in the distribution of shear from Miocene to Pliocene to the
                   formation of a relatively undeforming Aegea block in Pliocene that forced the shear to be distributed over a narrow plate boundary
                   to the north of it. We attribute the formation of this block to the northeastward progression of the oceanic Ionian slab. We propose
                   that the slab cuts the overlying lithosphere from asthenospheric sources and induces a shortening environment over it.

                   Résumé : Nous documentons l’établissement de la limite entre la plaque de la Mer Égée–Anatolie et celle de l’Eurasie au
                   Pliocène–Pléistocène. Avant 2 Ma, aucune limite de plaque n’était localisée au nord de la portion égéenne de la plaque anatoli-
                   enne et le cisaillement produit par le mouvement de la plaque anatolienne–égéenne par rapport à l’Eurasie était distribué sur
                   toute la largeur de la portion ouest de l’Égée–Anatolie occidentale. Il y a 4,5 Ma, une zone de cisaillement comparable au golfe
                   de Corinthe a été formée dans ce qui est l’actuelle mer de Marmara. Les bassins d’extension initiaux ont été recoupés par le
                   système de failles de décrochement principal de Marmara après 2,5 Ma. Peu de temps après, la limite de la plaque a migré à
                   l’ouest de la mer de Marmara, le long de la bordure nord de l’Égée, de la fosse nord de l’Égée à la région du golfe de Corinthe et
                   jusqu’à la faille de Kefalonia. Là, elle est ﬁnalement jointe à l’extrémité nord de la zone de subduction égéenne, complétant ainsi
                   le système de limites de plaques délimitant la plaque Anatolie–Égée. Nous avons relié le changement de la distribution du
                   cisaillement, entre le Miocène et le Pliocène, à la formation d’un bloc égéen relativement peu déformé au Pliocène; cela a
                   forcé la distribution du cisaillement sur une mince limite de plaque au nord du bloc. Nous attribuons la formation de ce bloc
                   à la progression de la plaque plongeante de l’océan ionien vers le nord-est. Selon nous, la plaque plongeante a coupé la
                   lithosphère sus-jacente des sources de l’asthénosphère, provoquant un environnement de raccourcissement au-dessus de la
                   plaque plongeante. [Traduit par la Rédaction]

Fig. 1. Tectonic map of Aegea – western Anatolia. Violet-coloured markings indicate shortening structures, yellow indicates normal faults,
green indicates left-slip faults, and white indicates the dextral North Anatolian Fault family including the normal faults of the Grecian Shear
Zone (Şengör 1979). All faults are Quaternary, as they cut Quaternary deposits established by sequence correlations in the Sea of Marmara.
Following the rule of Allen (1975), we assume all faults are active or potentially so. The light-colored, presently undeforming Aegean block
revealed by geodesy is limited by dashed lines. The dashed red contours of the Aegean slab are after Gudmundsson and Sambridge (1998). The
two yellowish shear zones that limit the Aegean Block, the Grecian Shear Zone (GSZ) and North Aegean Trough (NAT) to the north with
clockwise rotation and the Western Anatolian Shear Zone (WASZ) to the east with counterclockwise rotation, absorb ⬃20–25 mm/year of
shear, dextral for the northern zone and sinistral for the eastern zone. The ﬁgure is modiﬁed from Şengör and Zabcı (2016).

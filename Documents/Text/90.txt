           Brittle Shear Tectonics in a Narrow Continental Rift:
          Asymmetric Nonvolcanic Barmer Basin (Rajasthan, India)

                                                            ABSTRACT
Our ﬁeld studies emphasizing brittle shear P- and Y-planes along the margins of the Barmer basin (Rajasthan, India)
support its two-phase (NW-SE, followed by NE-SW) extension during Early Cretaceous and Late Cretaceous–Paleocene
periods. We also document nearly NE-trending megascale transfer zones along the northern margin of the Barmer basin.
Preexisting brittle planes in the Malani basement rocks guided the relay structures here. Structures at the western basin
shoulder margin indicate NE-SW extension, and the crosscut relation connotes the relative timing of the two extension
phases. The crosscutting conjugate fault sets are non-Andersonian. The NW-trending faults produced by the second-phase
extension and the inherited NNW-trending brittle features are dominantly dip-slip. Prior fractures of the Malani rocks
at ≥457 to the NE-SW principal extension direction extended the Barmer basin obliquely during the Late Cretaceous–
Paleocene period. The asymmetric nature of the rift, too, connotes its oblique rifting. The extension direction of the ﬁrst
phase probably rotated clockwise. This is derived mainly from WSW-trending faults cutting NE-trending faults. Brittle
planes of shear and fracture signiﬁcantly promoted ﬂuid ﬂow, as understood from secondary hydrothermal mineral
deposits (Barmer hill area) and pre-Deccan basalts (Sarnoo area). Reverse slip detected along subvertical faults on the
western and eastern rift shoulders are probably due to isostatic ﬂexure–related contraction or might be related to the far-
ﬁeld effect of ridge-push forces. The Mesozoic subsurface stratigraphy there and elsewhere within the Barmer basin re-
quires more study to substantiate the potential for structural entrapment of hydrocarbon.

                      Introduction
Rifting of continental crust is one of the key geo-                       case, crustal thinning may cause passive rising of

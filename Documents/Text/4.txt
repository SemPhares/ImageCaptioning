Abstract

    Submersible dives over the wedge of the easternmost Nankai Trough demonstrate the existence of a left-lateral
strike-slip system parallel to the subduction zone. This system develops as the trench, turning northward toward
land, becomes highly oblique to the motion. Although shear partitioning is well known in other subduction zones,
the process here has the peculiarity of continuing northward into land.

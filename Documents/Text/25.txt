Abstract

     The Bourcart–Hérault canyon interfluve in the Gulf of Lions (NW Mediterranean) was the site of very high sedimentation (up to
2.5 m/kyr) around the Last Glacial Maximum, due to the vicinity of major fluvial systems that fed the shelf edge. Shoreface deposits
and offshore muds deposited during each glacial/interglacial 100 kyr-cycle, created a repeated motif with high-angle and low-angle
clinoforms on seismic profiles. New detailed morphological, sedimentological and paleo-environmental data, constrained by 14C
dating, allow us to propose a scenario for the evolution of this critical area between 46 and 15 cal. kyr BP. The major seismic sequence
(S5), formed as a forced regression during the overall sea-level fall between MIS-3 and MIS-2, can be sub-divided into several
prograding units, which indicate that relative sea-level changes were punctuated by intervals of increased fall or slow-down, or even
stillstand. Similarly, the onset of sea-level rise was marked by steps, during which wave-cut terraces formed, and can be tracked all
around the Gulf of Lions. Three stillstands or slow-downs of sea-level change are identified and dated by deposits found at 90 m
relative sea-level (21 cal. kyr BP), 110–115 m rsl (18–17 cal. kyr BP), and 98–105 m rsl (before 15.9 cal. kyr BP). Cementation of
beach rocks, that now form eroded pinnacles culminating at 90 m, occurred during the 21 kyr stillstand. The position of relative sea-
level during the maximum lowstand is not known, but should be deeper than 115 m. Periods of increased northwesterly winds
favoured transport of coarser sediment at the shelf edge, in relation with deep water cascading: this created a distinct sandy interval
during the period of Heinrich event 2 (around 24 cal. kyr BP), at the origin of amplitude anomaly on very high-resolution seismic data.
The increased sea-level rise, around 15 cal. kyr BP, resulted in an abrupt decrease of sedimentation.

Absolute dates were obtained with accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) 14C dating of well-preserved shells and microfauna. AMS measurements
were made at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and at Poznan Radiocarbon Laboratory (PRL). The conventional radiocarbon datings
were done by “Centre de datation par le radiocarbone - Université Claude Bernard Lyon1” (Ly) and “Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières”
(BRGM). The ages reported herein are δ13C-normalised conventional 14C years, corrected for an assumed air–sea reservoir effect of − 400 yr, and then
converted into calibrated ages using the Calib v4.4 version (marine98.14c; Stuiver et al., 1998), and the Glacial polynomial (Bard et al., 1998).

component of the LGM shoreface was preserved, below 140 m water depth. The lowest sea-level is estimated to be at least 110–115 m and the onset
of rsl rise between 18 and 17 cal. kyr BP. A slow down of the transgression, between 17 and 15.9 cal. kyr BP, is marked by a bathymetric step at 98–
105 m. This period corresponds to the onset of deposition of thin transgressive sand bodies on the outer shelf (U155).

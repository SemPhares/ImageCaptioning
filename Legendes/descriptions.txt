57_1 this cross section is subparallel to the wamsutter arch and reflects the shallowest fort union formation coal across the gdb it highlights the two members of the fort union the upper fort union is the overland member with basal sandstone package present in all but the westernmost wells in the cross section and the lower fort union is the china butte member the lance formation is divided into red rim member at the top and the underlying unnamed lower member below the cross section shows thicker units overall in the deeper part of the central basin and thinner china butte member and lance formation on the flank of the rock springs uplift the red rim member of the lance formation does not reach the western third of the gdb either due to nondeposition on the structurally high rock springs uplift or erosion after deposition from later movement of the rock springs uplift
57_2 this cross section highlights thickening lance formation to the east that is approximately feet thicker than on the red rim member only extends across the eastern half of this cross section the china butte member thins to the west onto the flank of the rock springs uplift where all but the deadman coals are present the absence of lower china butte coals on the flank of the rock springs uplift suggests the uplift was structurally high during china butte time and the older coals that are present elsewhere in the gdb were not deposited near or on this structural high
57_3 this northern gdb section shows very thick lance formation throughout the gdb with maximum thickness toward the east there is only very thin red rim member in the center of the cross section coals from both the cherokee and china butte coal zones do not continue to the eastern wells in this cross section this absence of coals may be indicative of paleocene subsidence patterns isochore maps show the thickest parts of the gdb are in the northeast suggesting higher rate of relative subsidence that would have preferentially attracted and preserved fluvial deposition in this part of the basin
57_4 this cross section shows variability of the overland member of the fort union formation thinning onto the east flank of the rock springs uplift is accentuated by the erosional contact unconformity between the fort union formation and the overlying wasatch formation the overland member thickens significantly to the north away from influence of the rock springs uplift but no cherokee coals are interpreted in this region the basal sands of the overland member only appear in one well the lance formation thickens distinctly in the northern third of the cross section
57_5 this cross section is similar to in that it highlights the deepest part of the great divide basin in the coal beds of the china butte member are relatively straightforward and the overall thickness of the china butte does not vary the thick cherokee coal zone of the overland member is more discontinuous than in other sections but is still apparent the scotty lake coals highlighted in the picket lake well are here interpreted as part of the cherokee coals and not wasatch formation coals eocene as assumed by the operators of the wells in that region wogcc this section shows the deepest fort union coals in the gdb
57_6 this is the easternmost cross section in the gdb it shows from south to north thickening of the overland member and separation of the cherokee coals the basal sand package of the overland maintains relative uniform thickness but the china butte member thins slightly toward the south the china butte coals are contiguous and thick and become quite numerous in the northeast part of the gdb feature not observed in outcrop the red rim member of the lance formation is only present in the southern two thirds of as the lance formation thickens considerably into the northeast part of the basin
